/** An in-memory overlay of editor buffer contents, keyed by normalised absolute file path.
  *
  * The editor reports unsaved edits via `textDocument/didChange`; until those edits are saved the on-disk file is stale,
  * so the compiler must type-check the buffer, not the file. This overlay holds the live content of each open, modified
  * document and is consulted by [[VfsOverlayProcessor]], which intercepts `FileStat` / `FileContent` requests ahead of
  * the on-disk [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.source.stat.FileStatProcessor]] /
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.source.file.FileContentReader]]. A file without an override is read from disk as
  * usual, so the overlay is fully transparent to the CLI (which never populates it) and to unopened files.
  *
  * Each override carries a strictly increasing `stamp` (a monotonic tick, not a wall-clock time). The stat processor
  * reports that stamp as the file's modification time, so any buffer change makes the leaf `FileStat` differ and the
  * incremental generator invalidates exactly the edited file's dependency cone — while re-setting the *same* content
  * (re-applied byte for byte) still recompiles only down to the equality cutoff. Stamps start near zero, so they never
  * collide with a real on-disk mtime: dropping an override (on close) flips the stat back to the disk time, which
  * differs from any stamp, so the file is re-read from disk.
  *
  * The overlay is mutated from the lsp4j notification threads and read from compile fibers; an [[AtomicReference]] CAS
  * loop keeps those consistent without locking.
