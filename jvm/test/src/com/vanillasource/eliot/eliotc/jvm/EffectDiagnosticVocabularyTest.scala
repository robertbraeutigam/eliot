/** The gate on the *diagnostic* side: an error a user reads speaks payload and effect-row vocabulary, never compiler
  * machinery.
  *
  * Under effects v6 there is no carrier to leak into a message — the machinery the v5 version of this suite guarded
  * against (`AbortCarrier`, `ThrowCarrier`, the identity carrier `Id`, and the one inverter that rendered a stack back
  * as a pinned row) is deleted, and with it the two shapes that used to *need* the inverter: a carrier-stack ability
  * demand, and a pure-base `Id` row a side effect could not run on. Those cases are gone rather than rewritten,
  * because their subject is; what is left is the claim itself, which outlives the mechanism, plus the standing net
  * that no message names machinery.
  *
  * One of them is now a *positive* case: the `State`-over-`Throw` program that used to fail for want of a cross-lift
  * compiles and runs, because frames nest at the run site rather than needing an instance per layer pair.
  *
  * The failing programs here are compiled over the real base layer (`lang` + `stdlib` + `jvm`), because the shapes
  * only arise against the platform's own implementations.
