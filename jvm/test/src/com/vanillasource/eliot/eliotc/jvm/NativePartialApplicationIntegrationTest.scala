/** End-to-end regression for under-application of a **body-less native** — the complement of
  * [[OverApplicationIntegrationTest]], and the same kind of arity mismatch seen from the other side.
  *
  * A native is emitted once, at its declared arity, but a call site emits its call at whatever arity the spine has. An
  * under-applied native therefore linked to a method that was never generated: a clean compile and `NoSuchMethodError:
  * 'Function eliot.lang.String.substring(BigInteger, BigInteger)'` at runtime. `NativePartialApplication` now emits the
  * missing variants, one closure per missing argument.
  *
  * Only a partial application that becomes a **value** was affected, which is why this went unnoticed: a direct
  * `s.substring(0, 3)` is flattened by uncurrying into one full-arity call and builds no function at all. The last two
  * programs are the ones that made it reachable in ordinary code — a dot chain whose argument performs, where the
  * effectful part is hoisted out and the partial application left behind is `pure`-wrapped into the chain.
  *
  * These programs must run, not merely compile: the defect was invisible to the compiler.
