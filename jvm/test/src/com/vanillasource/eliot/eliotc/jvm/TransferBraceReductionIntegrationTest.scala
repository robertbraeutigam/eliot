/** End-to-end proof that a **stated** transfer brace reduces through the refinement channel at the call site — the
  * payoff of the transfer-reduction linker fix and the resolution of its "5b" inline-brace diagnosis (both recorded in
  * `docs/refinement-channel-follow-ups.md` §1). A brace desugars to a `^Meta` companion whose body is ordinary
  * compiler-track Eliot, so reducing it has to go through ability calls, generic constructor helpers and literal
  * endpoints; the escalating executor links only monomorphized callees, so an ability reference in a brace resolves
  * instead of sticking at ⊤ and yielding a wide result.
  *
  * Each case pairs an accepting and a rejecting program against the same `where` precondition, and the pair is the
  * point: accepting alone would also pass if the transfer widened to ⊤ and the precondition were discharged elsewhere,
  * rejecting alone would also pass if the meta were simply unknown — which is a different diagnostic ("Cannot prove" is
  * an absent bound, "not satisfied" a violated one), pinned separately below.
  *
  * **Why these programs no longer state their own braces.** This suite used to put the brace on an ordinary bodied test
  * def (`def f(a: Int, b: Int): Int {range(a) + range(b)} = a + b`). **R3** (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §3/§P3)
  * outlaws that shape: a bodied value *derives* its meta from its body, so only a native leaf may state one — and a
  * user module declares no natives. Each shape is therefore exercised through the layer brace that actually ships it
  * (`Numeric[Int]::add`, `Runtime::integerLiteral`, `Show[Int]::show`), and the last case pins R3 itself. Nothing is
  * lost by the move: the caveat the old suite carried — that lowering a brace-narrowed return across a *user* def's
  * call boundary is a deferred backend representation matter (`docs/refinement-channel-follow-ups.md` §4), since the
  * callee's body is compiled once with ⊤ parameters — was exactly a symptom of the shape R3 removes.
  *
  * The arguments are **direct calls** (`add(60, 60)`) rather than infix `60 + 60`: an infix spine reaches the channel
  * through a position it drops to ⊤, which is the intra-procedural limit `docs/string-length-meta.md` §9 already
  * describes and is not what these cases are about.
