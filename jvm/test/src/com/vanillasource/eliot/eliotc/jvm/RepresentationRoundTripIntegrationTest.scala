/** The backend's **round-trip peephole** (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §P4): a representation conversion whose only
  * consumer immediately undoes it is not emitted.
  *
  * The channel stamps a width on a node; the backend used to treat that as an obligation to *materialise* it, and then
  * to convert straight back wherever the consumer wanted something else. Both halves computed the same number. That was
  * invisible while a call boundary was ⊤ — nothing narrowed — and became common the moment the meta interpretation
  * (§P4's walk) started deriving a bound for every ordinary call: `Ranges`'s `count() + count() + count()` compiled to
  * three `BigInteger` ⤳ `Byte` ⤳ `BigInteger` trips around a sum it then computed at the wide width anyway.
  *
  * The rule that replaces it is one sentence: **a value is emitted at the width its consumer will read, and a consumer
  * that adapts to any width reads it as it arrives.** The cases below are the three edges that has to hold at — a
  * boundary result, a constant, an intrinsic's operand — and each asserts a *whole* method's instructions rather than a
  * window, because a conversion the peephole merely moved would still be absent from any one window.
  *
  * Each program also asserts its printed output, which is what makes assertions about *fewer* instructions safe: a
  * conversion wrongly dropped truncates the value or fails class verification, and both show up in what the program
  * prints.
