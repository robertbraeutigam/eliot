/** End-to-end proof of the **meta interpretation** (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §6.2/P4): a value with a body does
  * not *state* what it does to meta-information — R3 forbids it — it **derives** it, by having its body interpreted
  * under the caller's argument metas. Before this, a call to a bodied callee was a ⊤ boundary, so precision was a
  * property of *where code sits relative to a native* rather than of what the code *is*: `def label(s: String): String
  * = s` lost its argument's size at the call, and every helper a program factored out lost the bound it preserved.
  *
  * Each case is an accept/reject **pair** against the same `where` precondition, and the pair is the point: accepting
  * alone would also pass if the derivation widened to ⊤ and the precondition were discharged elsewhere, rejecting
  * alone would also pass if the meta were merely unknown — which is a *different* diagnostic ("Cannot prove" is an
  * absent bound, "not satisfied" a violated one). The accepting half additionally asserts the program's **output**,
  * which is what pins that the derived bound is not merely believed but true: the backend narrows the call node's
  * representation from it, so a bound that is too tight truncates the printed value rather than being caught
  * (`docs/string-length-meta.md` §8).
  *
  * The last two cases pin the boundaries this stage deliberately keeps: a **higher-order** call is still ⊤ (a lambda
  * carries no meta of its own — §5's table, which additionally waits on the `List` size domain), and a callee's own
  * `where` is still demanded at its *definition* over ⊤ parameters rather than re-demanded per use site (§P5).
