/** A **row alias** naming a definition's return type, end to end (`docs/effects.md` §2.4, §9.3 step 5).
  *
  * The alias is an ordinary type alias and the use an ordinary application — only the row's *entries* cross the use
  * site, never its payload — so what has to hold at runtime is that a definition naming one behaves exactly as the
  * written-out row does: it receives the row from its caller, its operations run on the implementation the boundary
  * binds, an entry's arguments follow the alias's own arguments, a row written out beside a named one adds to it, and
  * an effect the alias does not carry is still the "performs but does not declare" error.
  *
  * The alias being an ordinary **name** — so that it crosses files and is shadowed like any other — is asserted where
  * name resolution lives, in `resolve.processor.RowAliasesTest`; `examples/src/RowAlias.els` is the cross-module
  * witness the example sweep runs.
