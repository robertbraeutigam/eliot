/** End-to-end coverage of the termination preconditions and the no-recursion rule as they reach a real compile.
  *
  * M0 (preconditions): the strict-positivity check runs in `CoreProcessor` for every loaded file; the occurs-check half
  * is exercised at the unit level (`OccursCheckTest`). Here we confirm the declared negative-recursive-datatype route is
  * rejected through the full pipeline, while covariant self-reference (structural recursion in data) still compiles.
  *
  * M1 (the no-recursion rule): a self or mutual cycle in the body-level value-reference graph is rejected (the
  * `RecursionCheckProcessor`), while a non-recursive helper chain — however deep — compiles and runs, and the
  * monad-transformer lifting pattern (an impl method calling the same-named abstract method on an inner carrier) is not
  * mistaken for recursion.
  *
  * M2 (higher-order propagation, the function-coloring piece): because `Inf` is an ordinary effect and a suspended
  * slot supplies nothing, a single effect-transparent higher-order combinator is `Inf`-iff-its-step-is — terminating
  * over a terminating step, looping over an `Inf` step — with no separate termination lattice and no change to the
  * combinator. The step's own capability effects union with `Inf` at the caller that binds both, an `Inf` action
  * survives a round-trip through a data field, and the same subset check governs propagation through a higher-order
  * driver.
