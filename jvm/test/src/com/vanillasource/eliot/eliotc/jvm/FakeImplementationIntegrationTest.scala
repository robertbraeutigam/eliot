/** **Substituting a fake implementation** for a test, without the production code knowing — the testing strategy of
  * `docs/effects.md` §6, as effects v6 realises it.
  *
  * The mechanism is a **named implementation** plus a `with`. A named `implement` is never a default and is never
  * searched for, so it is free to overlap the platform's own instance without being checked against it (§9.4 step 4:
  * `with` *replaces* the search rather than parameterising it). Production code is untouched: it declares `{Console}`,
  * names no implementation, and what that row means is decided entirely at the test site.
  *
  * This suite replaces the v5 `AbilityConstraintDeclinationTest`, whose subject was carrier substitution and whose
  * mechanism — a jvm catch-all `implement[F[_] ~ Suspend] Console[F]` declining for a test's own pure carrier — went
  * with the carrier and with `Suspend`. The *claims* are the same and are kept here one for one; only the negative
  * cases changed shape, because what can go wrong changed.
  *
  * Run end to end over the real base layer, because the point is precisely how the *stdlib's* instances behave.
