/** End-to-end coverage of effectful-signatures **G1**: a guarded return type — a return whose *type* is a compile-time
  * computation that may reject — written with the **inline** guard vocabulary `if(cond, T) else raise(msg)` (plus a bare
  * `raise(msg)` for an unconditional rejection) over the effect carrier, compiled through the real pipeline with the
  * shipped `compiler`-layer `Either`/`Option`/`Abort` carriers.
  *
  * The guard rides the `{Throw[String]}`/`{Abort}` effect: `raise` expresses rejection and the pure arm expresses
  * acceptance, which the signature twin's compiler monomorphization reduces to `Left(msg)` / `Right(t)`. The consumer's
  * twin read then discharges — accepting the payload type or rejecting with the author's message. So a satisfied guard
  * compiles and runs as if the return were the bare type, and an unsatisfied one fails the build with the author
  * message. (This replaces the retired `eliot.lang.Guard` `when`/`orError` combinator surface — the signature split
  * Step 10; the inline form reduces through the same `if`/`else`/`fold`/`raise` machinery.)
  *
  * The checker's effect lift *does* elaborate the guard's branches, but the pure arm rides `if`'s own `{Abort}` return
  * and the `else` discharger consumes it, so a satisfied guard collapses to `Right(t)` rather than an unconditional
  * `Left`; that regression is what this suite guards against.

  /** What a rejecting guard does now: it **fails the build at the use site**, and that is all this can assert.
    *
    * It used to say what the *author* wrote — `raise("greeting unavailable")` — and that went with the compile-track
    * `Throw` (effects v6 F5; the reversal is recorded in `docs/effects.md` beside that deletion). With nothing
    * implementing `raise` there, a rejection does not reduce to the `Left(msg)` the guarded-return discharge reads;
    * it stays a stuck residue and surfaces as a type mismatch naming it. So the *safety* property is intact — a
    * rejecting guard never produces a jar — and the *diagnostic* is not. Asserting the exact text would be asserting
    * a residue's spelling, which is worse than asserting nothing; asserting the failure is the honest floor.
    *
    * The route back is a compile-track `Throw` keyed on a fixed marker the way `Abort` keys on `Aborted`.
