/** A definition gives a computation it was handed only what it has (`docs/effects.md` D20 rule 5). A row-typed slot's
  * caller writes the actual's bindings from the declaration, and an entry the slot supplies by `Default` is a promise
  * that a frame for it is entered before the actual runs. Only a callee's slot that supplies the entry — a discharger
  * the computation is passed on to — keeps that promise; a platform primitive, being body-less, is where every such
  * frame starts. The witness for §8 item 13 is the first case.
