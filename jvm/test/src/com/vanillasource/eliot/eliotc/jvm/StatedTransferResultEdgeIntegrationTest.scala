/** End-to-end proof of the **result-edge re-encode** (`docs/string-length-meta.md` §8, stage S3) and of the first
  * *stated* meta transfer that needs it: `def length(s: String): Int {size(s)}`.
  *
  * A leaf's stated transfer pins a narrow range on the **call node** — `length("hello")` is `[5, 5]`, which the backend
  * lays out as a `java.lang.Byte`. But `String::length` is emitted as a generated native static method whose return
  * descriptor is the ⊤ bignum, so without a conversion on the result edge the class verifier rejects the caller
  * (`VerifyError: 'java/math/BigInteger' is not assignable to 'java/lang/Byte'`). The backend already widens *arguments*
  * to the bignum boundary; this is the mirror of that on the way out.
  *
  * The suite asserts both halves, because either alone would pass while the feature was broken: the program must
  * **run** (the verifier accepts the class), and the transfer must actually reach the channel — which is what the
  * rejecting case pins, since an unknown bound can only make a precondition *unprovable*, never *violated*.
  *
  * What the re-encode is *not* is an obligation to materialise the narrow width wherever the channel stamped one. Since
  * the round-trip peephole (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §P4) a consumer that reads the ⊤ width anyway — an argument
  * slot, a method return — gets the boundary result unconverted, and a consumer that adapts to any width — an
  * intrinsic's operand — reads it as it arrives. So the re-encode is the *fallback* for a consumer that genuinely
  * demands the node's width, and the cases below pin both sides of that: what is emitted, and what is not.
