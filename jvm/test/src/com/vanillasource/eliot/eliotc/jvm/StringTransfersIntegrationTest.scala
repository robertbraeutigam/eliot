/** End-to-end proof of the **stated transfers on the `String` leaves** (`docs/string-length-meta.md` §6, stage S4):
  * the rest of `String.els`'s body-less definitions now say what their result's size is, so a size no longer stops at
  * the first call the way it did when only `length` stated one.
  *
  * Every leaf gets a *pair* of cases against the same eight-wide display, and the pair is the point. Accepting alone
  * would also pass if a transfer widened its result to ⊤ and the `where` were somehow discharged elsewhere; rejecting
  * alone would also pass if the size were simply unknown — which is a different diagnostic, and the suite pins that
  * difference too ("not satisfied" is a violated bound, "Cannot prove" is an absent one). Only both together show the
  * bound arriving at the call site with the precision the brace claims.
  *
  * Each program is a single expression rather than a block, and calls its leaf directly rather than through a dot. Both
  * are the intra-procedural limits `docs/string-length-meta.md` §9 already describes and neither is new here: a bodied
  * wrapper (`++`, `take`, `indexOf`) derives nothing until the meta interpretation lands, and the dot's
  * `Function.apply` bridge is one of the aliased positions the channel drops to ⊤ — the shipped `length` transfer
  * behaves the same way, so this suite would fail identically against `"abc".length`.
