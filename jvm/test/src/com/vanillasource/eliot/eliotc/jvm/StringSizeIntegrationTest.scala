/** End-to-end proof of the refinement channel's **second domain**: a `String`'s tracked `size`
  * (`docs/string-length-meta.md`). `type String {size: Bound[Interval[BigInteger]]}` declares the slot; a string
  * literal *seeds* the singleton size of its own length through the same literal-protocol `^Meta` path the integer
  * seed uses (`eliot.lang.Runtime::stringLiteral`'s `{Bounded(closed(N, N))}` brace).
  *
  * The point of the suite is that nothing between the seed and the diagnostic is `Int`-shaped: the meta structure, the
  * derived lattice and the `where` demand are all the shipped machinery, reached by declaring one slot on a second
  * type. So the cases mirror [[WhereOnDefIntegrationTest]]'s, and the code-point cases pin the one claim that is new
  * here — that a size counts what `String::length` counts, on every target.
  *
  * What the suite deliberately does *not* claim is precision beyond a literal: the channel is intra-procedural, so a
  * string arriving through a parameter or a call is ⊤ and a `where` over it is a hard error rather than a silent pass
  * (`docs/string-length-meta.md` §9). That is the same limitation the `Int` domain has, and the same fix retires both.
