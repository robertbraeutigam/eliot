/** End-to-end proof of `where`-on-defs — a refinement precondition on an ordinary `def`, verified at each use site by
  * the refinement channel (`docs/bounds-as-refinements.md` §4.3). `def useByte(x: Int): Int where withinByte(range(x))`
  * demands that every call's argument have a value range provably within `[0, 127]`; the channel reduces the
  * generated `^Where` companion over the argument's computed interval and rejects a caller whose range is out of bounds
  * or unknown (⊤). This is the use-site verification that closes the Step-6 enforcement gap (out-of-range `Int` values
  * had no JVM-backed rejection until now).
