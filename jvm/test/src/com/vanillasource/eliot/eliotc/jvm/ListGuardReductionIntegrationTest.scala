/** End-to-end proof of the compile-time twins of the `eliot.collection.List` leaves (effects v6 step 10.1.1,
  * `ListReductions`): a list is *decided while compiling*. An ability guard folds a literal list on the compiler track
  * — through the borrowed `foldLeft` body, `foldLeftInternal`'s twin and `Eq[String]`'s — so each `handler[..]` site is
  * bound to one implementation in the emitted bytecode, exactly as `Strings.els` decides its route table from
  * `startsWith`. Before the twins the fold stayed stuck and the guard could not be evaluated.
  *
  * The pair of implementations is the point: a guard that could not reduce would fail to *select*, not select the
  * wrong one, so a single accepted case would also pass with the guard silently defaulted — both branches being chosen
  * from one list shows the fold answering `true` and `false` from the same chain. The negative branch is spelled
  * `all(w -> !(w == S), …)` rather than `!any(…)`: a rowed call is `Either[String, Bool]` on the compile track and a
  * guard body is not elaborated, so `!` over it is a type mismatch — a standing limitation of guards, not of lists.
