/** A field holds a value (`docs/effects.md` D20 rule 6). A row on a `data` field once stored a computation: a thunk
  * whose operations were bound where the value was constructed, read back later. That binding outlived what it named —
  * the constructor supplied the platform's default where a test's double was meant (§8 item 12), and a discharger's
  * frame was gone by the time the read ran it — so a row anywhere in a field's type is rejected, and the work is stored
  * as data and performed where the effects are in scope.
