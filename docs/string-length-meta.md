# A length meta for `String` — the refinement channel's second domain

Status: **shipped through S2 — the domain is live.** S0 (code-point indices), **S1** (the `size` slot) and **S2**
(the literal seed, plus the LSP gate) have all landed; a `where` precondition over a string's size is checked at every
use site today. What remains is design: S3 (the backend result-edge re-encode), S4 (the `String.els` transfers) and S5
(⊤ / arming R2) — see §10.

The domain cost **one** compiler arm (§3.1) and one Eliot declaration beside it. Everything else — the meta structure,
the derived `Meta` lattice, the `^Where` demand, the transfer name transform — was the shipped machinery, reached by
declaring a slot on a second type. That is the claim §1 made for going second with `String` rather than `List`, and it
held.

All of §11's decisions are now **settled**. The unit is the **code-point count** (§5.1), which added a prerequisite
stage S0 (the index family switched units with `length`) and rules out a byte-size slot (§5.2) and any second slot
before S5 (§5.3). The **⊤ question is gone** — the range domain grew a top (`whole`,
`total-meta-transfers.md` §5), which this domain inherits for free and, per the §7 correction, does not actually need:
a `String` size is bounded by a representation like anything else. The slot is named **`size`** (§3.2), the scope
landed was **S1+S2** (§11.4), and R2 stayed **dormant** across it (§11.5).

Prior art, and the two documents this one sits between:

- `docs/total-meta-transfers.md` — meta as a shadow logic (R1–R4, the leaf/derive split). Its §2.3 defers
  *structural* meta types to "the second refinement domain (`List`/`Array` `size`)". This is that second domain,
  in the one shape that needs **no** structural meta.
- The shipped value-range domain: `type Int {range: Interval[BigInteger]}`,
  `monomorphize/channel/RefinementChannelProcessor`, `core/processor/Meta{Constructor,Transfer,Where}Desugarer`.

---

## 1. What is being added, and why this one first

```eliot
type String {size: Interval[BigInteger]}
```

(The `Bound` wrapper is the range domain's stated top, inherited by every domain — see §7. Predicate and stage
examples further down were written before it landed and spell the bare `Interval`; read them as the wrapped form.)

A `String` gains one meta slot: the interval of its length, in the units `String::length` counts — which §5.1
decides is the **code-point count**, and which S0 makes true of every target. That single line turns on the whole
channel for strings — merges, `where` preconditions, transfers, hover — because everything downstream of a slot
declaration is already domain-agnostic.

**One** slot, deliberately, and it holds a count of code points rather than of storage units. Both halves of that
are load-bearing and §5 argues them: the unit must be a property of the string *value* or a `where` stops meaning
the same thing on two targets (§5.1), and byte size does not join it as a second slot because a byte count is what a
backend *derives* from `size`, exactly as an `Int`'s machine width is derived from its `range` (§5.2).

Why `String` and not `List` first, even though the TODO names `List`/`Array` `size` as the next domain: **`String`
is nullary.** `meta(List[A])` wants to be structural (`List$Meta(size, meta(A))`, meta as a functor on the type
structure — `total-meta-transfers.md` §2.3), which drags in a decision about recursive `data` and multiplies the
leaves forced to state a transfer. `String` has no element type, so its meta is a plain one-slot structure exactly
like `Int`'s, and it needs **no** change to `metaTypeOf`, no functor, no recursion story. It is the second domain
minus its hardest sub-problem — and it is the domain that proves the machinery is genuinely generic rather than
`Int`-shaped, which is the precondition for `List` size later.

What it buys today:

- `where` preconditions over strings — the fixed-width case that motivates the whole channel on a microcontroller
  (`def banner(s: String): Unit where fitsDisplay(size(s))`).
- **Cross-domain flow**: `length`'s stated transfer turns a string's size into an `Int`'s range, so a literal's
  length feeds `Int` arithmetic, `Int` `where`s, and (later) array bounds. *Verified* (§4.4).
- **A bound on a parsed number**: `parseInt` on a string of `n` code points yields an `Int` in `[-(10ⁿ-1), 10ⁿ-1]`,
  so a fixed-width input field lands in a known `Int` range without a `where` on the number. This is the everyday
  motivation, and it is the reason the unit has to be a count of characters rather than of bytes (§5.1, §6).
- A representation story for a future MCU backend: a `String` whose size is pinned to `[0, 16]` can be laid out as
  a fixed buffer, exactly as an `Int` pinned to `[0, 255]` is laid out as a byte today.
- The first honest test of R2 (`total-meta-transfers.md`) against a leaf set that is *not* three arithmetic
  operations. That test does not go well, and §7 says so.

---

## 2. What the existing machinery already gives, unchanged

Everything in this list works with **zero compiler change** once the slot is declared. This is the payoff of the
channel's "the `^Meta` companion is the one recognition point" discipline.

| mechanism | what happens for `String` | status |
|---|---|---|
| meta structure | `MetaConstructorDesugarer` emits `data String$Meta(size: Interval[BigInteger])` + accessor | *verified* |
| lattice | the auto-derived `Meta[String$Meta]` joins the slot through `Meta[Interval[T]]` | *verified* (compiles) |
| `metaTypeOf` | `String` ⤳ `String$Meta` by the same membership test, no new case | *shipped* |
| branch merges | `fold^Meta` reduces at `A := String$Meta`; `if`/`match` over strings joins for free | **does not fire — and does not fire for `Int` either**, see below |
| `where` | `MetaWhereDesugarer` already retypes *every* parameter `T` ⤳ `T$Meta`; a `where` over a `String` parameter needs no change (its own doc comment names this as the second-domain work) | *verified* (§4.3) |
| transfers | a return brace on a `String`-returning def desugars as usual; a **cross-domain** brace (`String$Meta` in, `Int$Meta` out) is just the ordinary per-position name transform | *verified* (§4.2) |
| backend | `IntRepresentation.isIntegerType` gates every width decision, so a `String$Meta` stamped on a node is ignored by the JVM backend | *verified* (§4.1) — but see §8 |

Every row held on landing except the branch merge, and that one failed **in both domains**, so it is not a property
of this domain. `banner(fold(true, "ab", "abcd"))` reports *"an argument's meta-information is not known here"* rather
than joining `[2,2]` and `[4,4]`; so does `asByte(fold(true, 1, 1000))` with the shipped `Int` range. Whatever reaches
`fold`'s arms at the demand is ⊤ for a string exactly as it is for an integer — a plausible culprit is that
`fold[A](condition: Bool, whenTrue: {Effect} A, …)` now takes its arms as *rows*, so a pinned arm meta no longer
survives to the call node, but that was not chased down here. It is an `Int`-domain regression to find and fix on its
own evidence; the `String` domain neither caused it nor is blocked by it, and no test in the tree asserted a branch
merge narrows, which is how it went unnoticed. Both jar sweeps are byte-identical across this change, so nothing
about layout moved either way.

---

## 3. The three compiler changes

**All three have landed.** The sections below are kept as written, with what shipped noted against each.

### 3.1 The α seed for string literals (the only real one)

Before this, a string literal was ⊤: `RefinementChannelProcessor.walkFlow` fell through to `case _`. Nothing else can
originate a `String` meta, so without a seed the whole domain is inert — which is precisely what made the
declaration safe to land alone (§4.1).

Mirror the integer seed. `eliot.lang.Runtime` already carries `def integerLiteral[V: BigInteger]: Int {closed(V,
V))}`; add its string twin and one arm in the channel:

```eliot
// stdlib/eliot/eliot/lang/Runtime.els
def stringLiteral[N: BigInteger]: String {closed(N, N)}
```

```scala
// RefinementChannelProcessor.walkFlow, beside the IntegerLiteral arm
case MonomorphicExpression.StringLiteral(value) =>
  val text = value.value
  metaViaCompanion(
    WellKnownTypes.stringLiteralFQN,
    Seq(GroundValue.Direct(BigInt(text.codePointCount(0, text.length)), bigIntType)),
    Seq.empty
  ).map(meta => Flow(meta, recordAt(node, meta)))
```

**Landed as written**, `Bound`-wrapped for the domain top the range domain grew meanwhile. The prototype counted
`text.length`; with §5.1 resolved to code points that is the wrong measure (it counts UTF-16 units) and
`codePointCount` replaced it — which is what `StringSizeIntegrationTest` pins with a supplementary-character literal
that fits a four-wide bound and would not if storage units were counted.

`stringLiteral` is a declaration no program ever calls (a literal's characters are already the value, so unlike
`integerLiteral` nothing desugars into it). That is deliberate: it is the vessel that keeps the seed's *construction*
in Eliot, so the channel supplies a number and the language builds the meta.

Note what the channel does and does not decide. It supplies a raw `BigInteger` — the literal's measured length —
exactly as the integer seed supplies the literal's value; the *interval*, the singleton, and the `String$Meta`
wrapper are all built in Eliot, in the brace. The channel still constructs no domain structure. It does now know
that a string's meta is measured by counting, which is one notch more domain knowledge than the integer seed
carries — but because §5.1 fixes the unit as the code-point count, that knowledge is **platform-independent**: the
channel is not guessing a host representation, it is counting the same thing every target's `length` counts.

That is what retires the alternative the prototype left open (passing the literal *string* as the type argument and
letting the brace call a per-platform compile-time `sizeOf(v: String): BigInteger` native). A contributed native is
only needed when the unit is platform data; once the unit is the string value's own code-point count, the direct
count is both cheaper and *more* correct — one native and one name saved. See §5.1.

### 3.2 The slot cannot be called `length`

*Verified, and it is a hard error, not a preference:*

```
stdlib/eliot/eliot/lang/String.els:4: Name was already defined in this module.
  type String {length: Interval[BigInteger]}
               ^^^^^^
```

A meta slot generates its accessor (`length(m: String$Meta): Interval[BigInteger]`) in the type's **own module and
the Default namespace**, where `def length(s: String): Int` already lives. `Int` never hit this because nothing in
`eliot.lang.Int` is called `range`.

Two ways out:

- **v1: name the slot `size`.** Reads well in the two places it appears (`size(s)` in a brace or a `where`), leaves
  `length` to the runtime function it belongs to, and costs nothing. *Verified.*
- **The structural fix: put meta accessors in `Qualifier.Meta`.** A slot accessor is compile-time-only machinery; it
  has no business sharing a namespace with the type's public API, and the collision will recur for every future
  domain whose natural slot name is also a natural function name (`List`'s `size` and `List::size`, say). It means
  teaching the brace/`where` desugarers to resolve accessors in that namespace, so it is its own small slice.

Take `size` now; log the namespace fix as the follow-on that lets a later domain use whatever name it wants.

**Landed as `size`.** The namespace fix stays a follow-on, and it is `List`'s problem first: `List`'s natural slot name
is also `size`, and unlike `String::length` the collision there is with the function users reach for most.

### 3.3 The LSP hover would mislabel a string's size as a value range

`TypeHintIndex.boundsOf` decodes *any* `X$Meta(Interval(lo, hi))` shape and the hover renders it as the node's value
range. Its own comment says "`None` for any other meta (a future domain), which is simply not shown as a range" —
but the match is structural, and `String$Meta(Interval(5, 5))` has exactly that shape. Hovering `"hello"` would
report a value range of `5..5`.

Fix with the same gate the backend uses: decode only when the node's type is the tracked `Int` (or only when the
meta's own FQN is `Int$Meta`). Cosmetic, one line, but it lands the moment the seed does — and §7's guidance is that
a wrong *rendering* is the only place recognising a domain by name is sanctioned, so this is where to do it.

**Landed**, taking the second option (the meta's own FQN), since the LSP module has no dependency on the backend's
`isIntegerType` and the node's type is not in hand at the decode. `TypeHintRangeCompileTest` covers it by hovering a
string literal and asserting *no* range — a test that fails without the gate, which was checked by removing it.

The same reasoning caught one more user-facing text: the channel's own `where` diagnostics said *"the argument's value
range"*, which is the `Int` domain's vocabulary in a processor that has none. They now say *"meta-information"* — the
language's own word for exactly this (`ability Meta`), true of every domain.

---

## 4. What the prototype proved

The prototype was: the `size` slot, the `Meta` import in `String.els`, `stringLiteral`'s declaration, the
`WellKnownTypes` FQN, and the channel arm — 19 lines. Everything below was run.

### 4.1 The declaration alone is inert and harmless

With `type String {size: Interval[BigInteger]}` and no seed, `HelloWorld`, `Strings`, `Concat`, `Unicode`,
`WherePrecondition`, `Ranges`, `MatchRanges`, `IntField`, `Match` and `Arithmetic` all compile clean. Nothing
originates a string meta, so every node stays ⊤. The slot can therefore land as its own commit.

### 4.2 Cross-domain transfers desugar and typecheck

Both of these compile with no compiler change:

```eliot
def length(s: String): Int {size(s)}                      // String$Meta in, Int$Meta out
implement Combine[String] {
   def combine(a: String, b: String): String {size(a) + size(b)}   // Interval addition, as Int's `add`
}
```

`length^Meta(s: String$Meta): Int$Meta = Int$Meta(size(s))` falls straight out of `MetaTransferDesugarer`'s
per-position name transform — the mixed-domain case needed no special arm, which is the strongest evidence that the
transfer language is not `Int`-shaped.

### 4.3 A `where` over a string parameter works, in both directions

```eliot
def fitsFive(i: Interval[BigInteger]): Bool = lessThanOrEqual(end(i), 5)
def label(s: String): String where fitsFive(size(s)) = s

def main: {Console} Unit = printLine(label("hello"))          // compiles, runs, prints `hello`
```

and with an eleven-character literal:

```
StringSize.els:5:38: The precondition of 'StringSize::label' is not satisfied by the argument's value range.
```

A use-site check, discharged from the literal seed through the auto-derived instances, with no channel knowledge of
strings beyond the seed.

### 4.4 The cross-domain path carries all the way into the `Int` domain

```eliot
def withinFive(i: Interval[BigInteger]): Bool = lessThanOrEqual(end(i), 5)
def small(x: Int): Int where withinFive(range(x)) = x

def main: {Console} Unit = printLine(show(small(length("hello"))))        // accepted
//                                         small(length("hello world"))  // rejected at the call
```

`"hello"` ⤳ `String$Meta(Interval(5,5))` ⤳ `length^Meta` ⤳ `Int$Meta(Interval(5,5))` ⤳ the `Int` `where`. The two
domains compose through the ordinary machinery.

### 4.5 …and that exact program then fails to *run* — see §8

---

## 5. Units, and why byte size is not a second slot

### 5.1 The unit is the code-point count — decided

`String.els` documents `length` as counting "the platform's storage units, not user-perceived characters", and the
JVM leaf is `java.lang.String::length` — UTF-16 code units. A UTF-8 target would count differently for the same
literal. So "the length of `"日本"`" is not today a platform-independent number, and the seed has to get it from
*somewhere*.

Three answers were on the table:

1. **Pragmatic.** The channel counts with the host's `String.length` (what the prototype did). That is exactly what
   `StringReductions` already does for the compile-time `length` native, so the seed agrees with the compile-time
   leaf by construction — but it bakes a JVM-flavoured assumption into a platform-independent module.
2. **Contributed.** The seed calls a per-platform compile-time `sizeOf` native living beside that platform's own
   `length` reduction. The unit is then defined once per platform, in the place that already has to agree with the
   runtime leaf value-for-value (`total-meta-transfers.md` §2.1, "a leaf's transfer is platform data").
3. **Define it away.** Declare the language's string length to be the **code-point** count and make every
   platform's `length` conform (JVM: `codePointCount`).

**Take (3).** (1) and (2) both leave `size` a per-target number, and a `where` precondition over a per-target
number is a precondition that holds on the JVM and fails on an MCU — a portability hole in the one channel whose
whole purpose is a portable compile-time guarantee. Only the code-point count is a property of the *string value*
rather than of a representation, which is what the Platform-Independence cornerstone requires of anything the base
layer can name. This is a **language decision**, not a channel implementation detail, and it is the answer that
also makes §6's two unbounded leaves statable.

**The bill is larger than "a behaviour change to `length`".** `String.els:8-11` already promises that `length` and
the index family agree — "Use it for slicing with `substring`/`take`/`drop`, which index in the same units". So the
unit cannot be changed in `length` alone; it changes in every index-taking leaf, or the API becomes incoherent
(`s.substring(0, s.length)` would truncate a string containing a non-BMP code point):

| leaf | today | after |
|---|---|---|
| `length` | `String.length()` (`StringNatives.scala:138`) | `codePointCount(0, length())` |
| `substring` | UTF-16 indices (`StringNatives.scala:214`) | `offsetByCodePoints` on both clamped indices |
| `take` / `drop` | bodied on `substring` | unchanged — inherit it |
| `indexOfInternal` | UTF-16 index | `codePointCount(0, idx)` on the result |
| compile-time reductions | `s.length` / host `substring` (`StringReductions.scala:40`, `:76-93`) | same translation, so the two tracks keep agreeing |

That is ~5 leaves plus their compile-time twins, and it costs O(n) index translation on the JVM.

**Land it as its own change, ahead of the meta work, and justify it without the meta work.** — **done, as S0**; the
table above is now history rather than a plan, and `split`/`replace` on their empty argument moved with it (§10).
Before that change `length("日本語𝕏")`
returned a different number per target, so any string-slicing user program was already non-portable — the meta domain
did not create that defect, it only made it visible. "Eliot string indices are code points" stands on its own as a
cornerstone fix; smuggling it in as a refinement-channel prerequisite would have made both changes harder to review.

Then say it in `String.els`'s doc comment: **the meta counts the same units `length` returns, and that unit is the
code point.** The meta must never be able to disagree with the function.

### 5.2 Byte size is a backend derivation, not a slot

The tempting next step is a second slot — `type String {size: …, bytes: …}` — on the grounds that when a string is
*stored* it is bytes that matter. The need is real; the slot is the wrong home for it, and `Int` already settled the
question.

`type Int {range: Interval[BigInteger]}` carries no byte width. It carries the **value range**, and the backend
derives Byte/Short/Int/BigInteger from it (`IntRepresentation.isIntegerType` gates every width decision — §2, §8).
The width is not meta-information; it is what a backend computes *from* meta-information using knowledge only it
has.

Strings are the same shape: **bytes is to `size` what the JVM's `Byte` choice is to an `Int`'s range.** An MCU
backend that wants to lay a `[0,16]`-size string into a fixed buffer multiplies `size` by its own maximum
bytes-per-code-point — a number only that backend knows. A `bytes` slot in `stdlib/eliot/eliot/lang/String.els`
would have the base layer assert that every string has a byte count, in units the base layer is forbidden to name.
That is exactly the "no platform *representation*" line.

The mechanism cannot rescue it either. A transfer brace desugars in `core` (phase 4) into an ordinary named value —
`length^Meta` — which `module` (phase 5) then merges across layers, so two layers each giving it a body is "Has
multiple implementations." **Per-platform transfer braces are impossible**; the only per-platform hook is a native
leaf reduction (§5.1's rejected option 2). A `bytes` slot would therefore be a base-layer slot that no base-layer
brace could ever honestly fill.

### 5.3 Any second slot is downstream of the ⊤ decision

This is a general constraint on the domain, worth stating once because it applies to every future slot and not just
to bytes.

Multi-slot metas are structurally free: `MetaConstructorDesugarer` reuses `DataDefinitionDesugarer` verbatim and the
auto-derived `Meta` instance joins field-wise, so `String$Meta(size, bytes)` and its lattice would fall out with no
compiler change. The cost is on the *transfer* side. A brace is a positional comma-separated list applied straight
to the meta constructor (`MetaTransferDesugarer.metaBody` builds `String$Meta(braceExprs*)`, parsed by
`optionalBracketedCommaSeparatedItems`), so **partial statement is not expressible**: a def either states every slot
or carries no brace at all and is ⊤ in all of them.

With one slot, "unstated ⇒ ⊤" is free. With two, "I know the size but not the bytes" has to be *spelled* as an
explicit unbounded interval — which is precisely the open-endpoint question §6 and S5 defer. **A second slot pulls
the ⊤ decision forward out of S5 into S2**, against §7's sequencing. Keep the domain at one slot until S5 lands.

The second slot that would genuinely earn itself later is not raw bytes but an **encoding claim** — a small
`ascii ⊑ latin1 ⊑ unicode` lattice, letting a backend tighten bytes to exactly `size` for an ASCII string. It is a
real fact no function of `size` determines, and it would be the first non-`Interval` domain, which is what proves
the lattice is generic rather than `Interval`-shaped. Two things it would need beyond the slot: a user-declared
`Meta[Encoding]` instance (the derived compound join dispatches per slot to the *domain's* instance, and only
`Meta[Interval[T]]` exists today) and a domain head that is a simple type application, since
`MetaConstructorDesugarer.slotJoin` yields no instance otherwise. Still downstream of S5.

---

## 6. The transfers the `String` leaves would state

Not needed for v1 (an unstated leaf is ⊤ — sound, just wide), but this is the list R2 will demand (§7), and working
it out is what shows where the domain is genuinely hard. `n` abbreviates `size(s)`.

| leaf | honest transfer | note |
|---|---|---|
| `combine` (`++`) | `{size(a) + size(b)}` | exact; `Interval` addition, as `Int`'s `add` |
| `length` | `{size(s)}` | cross-domain, exact |
| `substring(start, end, s)` | `{Interval(0, min(end(range(end)) - start(range(start)), end(n)))}` | clamping makes the lower bound `0` |
| `take` / `drop` | derived from `substring` — **if** derivation existed (§9) | today: bodied ⇒ ⊤ |
| `trim` | `{Interval(0, end(n))}` | |
| `toUpperCase` / `toLowerCase` | `{Interval(start(n), end(n) * 3)}` | **not** length-preserving: `ß` ⤳ `SS`, `ﬃ` ⤳ `FFI`. The discipline catches a bug an eyeball would not. The `* 3` factor is a code-point fact, so §5.1 makes this row portable rather than JVM-flavoured |
| `repeat(count, s)` | `{Interval(0, end(range(count)) * end(n))}` | the other cross-direction: an `Int` meta drives a `String` meta |
| `replace(target, replacement, s)` | `{Interval(0, end(n) + (end(n) + 1) * end(size(replacement)))}` | an empty `target` inserts between every pair, so the occurrence count is `n+1` |
| `Show[Int]::show` | a digit count of `range(value)`, plus one for the sign | statable — see below |
| `parseIntInternal` | `{Interval(-(10ⁿ - 1), 10ⁿ - 1)}` | statable — see below |
| `readLine`, environment/file/process reads | platform max | **no honest bound on the JVM** |

**§5.1 retires the two hardest rows.** Both were unbounded *because* the unit was a storage count:

- `parseIntInternal`: `n` code points admit at most `n` decimal digits (`isInteger` allows an optional sign, which
  only reduces the count), so `|value| ≤ 10ⁿ - 1`. Honest, and exactly the bound that motivates the domain — a
  parsed field of known width lands in a known `Int` range.
- `Show[Int]::show`: the digit count of an interval is a function of its endpoints, so `show` is bounded whenever
  its argument's range is. It inherits ⊤ only from a ⊤ argument, which is the ordinary situation, not a missing
  bound of its own.

One prerequisite `parseIntInternal` exposes: the brace needs **exponentiation over `BigInteger` at compile time**,
and `StdlibNativesProcessor` offers only `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`. It cannot be written in Eliot either — a
recursion-free core has no loop (the *Total by Default* cornerstone) — so this is one new native leaf, in the same
place the arithmetic leaves already live.

That leaves one genuinely unbounded row instead of three. `total-meta-transfers.md` §5 argues that no leaf needs a
⊤ form, because "on a real target every meta-carrying type has a representation, hence a bound"; an unbounded
*input* read (`readLine`, a file, an environment variable) remains the counterexample, and the ⊤ question (S5) is
still owed for it — either `Interval` grows open endpoints, or these leaves state `2³¹-1`-flavoured bounds that are
true but useless, or R2 keeps an escape.

---

## 7. Interaction with R2 accounting — this makes arming harder, not easier

`MetaTransferAccountingProcessor` (landed at `526c7bc`, registered but **undemanded**) reports a body-less value
whose declared return head is a concrete meta-carrying type and which states no transfer. Its §P2 arming list was
five leaves: `String::length`, `indexOfInternal`, `parseIntInternal`, `Process::exitCode`, jvm `outcomeExitCode`.

Declaring `String` meta-carrying makes **every body-less `String`-returning leaf** join that list — the `String.els`
set above, plus `Path::show`, `File::message`, `Process::standardOutput`/`standardError`, `Environment`'s and the
jvm layer's private internals. Roughly a dozen more. §5.1 helps here: the `String.els` set is now statable almost
throughout (§6).

**Correction, since the ⊤ decision has landed.** This section used to say the *input* leaves — `readLine`,
environment, file and process reads — would need a ⊤ escape. They do not, and the reason is the same one
`total-meta-transfers.md` §5 gives for every other leaf: **a representation is a bound.** A JVM `String` holds at
most `2³¹−1` units, so `readLine` states `Bounded([0, 2³¹−1])` — closed, ordinary, and it keeps the fact that a
size is non-negative, which is the half worth having. Wide is not the same as unbounded.

The domain top that *did* land (a slot-level `Bound`, since collapsed into `whole` — `total-meta-transfers.md` §5)
existed for a different and much narrower reason: a
leaf whose bound is **exponential in its argument's meta**. `parseIntInternal` is the only one, and it is in the
`Int` domain, not this one. So this domain needs the top for nothing, and inherits it for free.

**Amendment, since half-open intervals landed** (`total-meta-transfers.md` §5). The correction above stays right
for a *leaf*: a leaf's transfer is platform data contributed beside its native, so the jvm `readLine` states
`closed(0, 2³¹−1)` and should. What it does not license is stating a maximum in the **base** — an abstract
`def length(s: String): Int` has no platform to read one from. That is now expressible without inventing one:
`atLeast(0)` states the half that is true on every target, and a platform narrows it to a closed range
where the base signature is redefined. So this domain gains a use for open endpoints that the `Int` domain reached
by the same route, and the sequencing conclusion below is unaffected.

The sequencing conclusion is unchanged and now unblocked: **land the `String` domain while R2 is dormant, and arm
R2 afterwards**, so the dozen new leaves are stated once rather than twice. Nothing here blocks the domain — an
unstated leaf is ⊤ today, which is exactly what a `String` leaf is right now anyway.

## 8. The backend gap the prototype found

The §4.4 program compiles and then dies at class-verification time:

```
java.lang.VerifyError: Bad type on operand stack
  Type 'java/math/BigInteger' is not assignable to 'java/lang/Byte'
```

Diagnosis. Stating `{size(s)}` on `length` makes the channel pin `[5,5]` on the **call node**, so the backend picks
that node's representation as `Byte` (`repInternalNameOf` reads the stamped meta). But `String::length` is emitted
as a *generated native static method* whose return descriptor is the ⊤ `BigInteger`. The backend widens **arguments**
to bignum at every ordinary call boundary (`generateArgumentToBignum`) but has no symmetric re-encode on a call's
**result** edge — because until now no ordinary call node ever carried a narrow meta. `Numeric[Int]`'s `add` is
invisible to this: it is an *inline intrinsic*, so the backend already controls the width it leaves on the stack.

This is precisely the hazard `total-meta-transfers.md` §7 warns about — "get that wrong and it arrives as a
`ClassCastException`, not a type error" — reached from the other side: not a callee's interior, but a leaf whose
stated transfer outruns its emitted descriptor.

Three ways to close it, in order of preference:

1. **Re-encode on the result edge.** After invoking a generated native static method, convert from the method's
   declared return representation to the node's stamped one — the mirror of `generateArgumentToBignum`, using the
   conversion the backend already has. Small, local, and it makes *every* future stated transfer on a static-method
   leaf work.
2. **Stamp nothing at a static-method call node** (only intrinsics, literals and merges narrow). Sound and trivial,
   but it throws away the transfer's whole point.
3. **Emit the native at the narrowed width** — call-site-sensitive codegen for a shared method. Rejected: it splits
   a native per call-site meta, and refinements must stay invisible to monomorphization identity.

Take (1), and land it **with** the first stated `String` transfer, not after. Until a transfer is stated the gap
cannot fire (§4.1 verified a clean sweep), so it does not block the slot — but it does block `length`'s brace, which
is the first thing anyone will write.

## 9. Precision reality check — say this in the docs before someone tries it

The channel is intra-procedural (`RefinementChannelProcessor`: a parameter, a value reference, a lambda body are all
⊤). So what actually narrows is: string literals, and directly-called leaves with stated transfers, within one body.

```eliot
def greet(name: String): String = "Hello, " ++ name      // ⊤: `name` is a parameter
def banner: String = "-" ++ "-"                          // [2,2] — literal ++ literal, via combine^Meta
def label(s: String): String = s                         // bodied: derives nothing today, so ⊤ at the call
```

That is the same shape of limitation `Int`'s range already has, and the same fix retires both: the **meta
interpretation** of `total-meta-transfers.md` §6.2/P4, which interprets a callee's body under the caller's argument
metas. `String` size is not a reason to build it, and it is not blocked by its absence — but the first user report
will be "why is my string's size unknown", and the answer should already be written down.

Two facts about *today's* channel sharpen this, both worth knowing before S2/S3 (found while auditing this section;
the first is still open, the second is fixed):

- **"a lambda body is ⊤" is really "any def that takes a parameter is ⊤, throughout".** `walkFlow`'s lambda arm drops
  its subtree's *records*, not merely its own verdict — and a def's own parameters are leading `FunctionLiteral`s in
  the monomorphized body, so a parametered def produces an **empty** `RefinementTable`. The examples above narrow
  because they are paramless; move the identical expression into `def banner(unused: Bool): String` and it is ⊤ again.
  `where` demands still fire there (they are checks made during the walk, not records), so this is precision only. It
  dissolves under P4, whose §7 separates "what the meta is" from "what may be stamped" — which is exactly this
  conflation.
- **A meta may not be recorded without also recording the ⊤s around it.** The table is matched to the backend's tree
  by *source position*, and desugaring makes positions non-unique: a pure `val` block lowers to `(x -> rest)(e)` with
  the synthesized lambda and application both anchored on the bound expression's range. Recording only pinned nodes
  let the bound expression's meta be read as the application's, and the backend duly re-encoded a `Function.apply`
  result to `Byte` — §8's hazard, reached with no stated transfer at all. The channel now records ⊤ verdicts too, so
  an aliased position is ambiguous and drops to ⊤. Any new recording site inherits this obligation.

`String::show` being the identity is a good miniature of this: it is *bodied*, so under R3 it may not state a
transfer, and until P4 exists it derives nothing. Correct and useless — exactly the pattern §8.3 of
`total-meta-transfers.md` predicted for `foldLeft`.

## 10. Staging

Each stage compiles and passes the example sweep on its own.

- **S0 — code-point indices** (§5.1) — **LANDED**. `length` and the whole index family (`substring`,
  `indexOfInternal`, and their `StringReductions` twins) switched to code-point units; `take`/`drop` inherited it. A
  **prerequisite, not part of this feature**: it is a cornerstone fix that stands on its own, it touches no channel
  code, and it was reviewed as a language change rather than as refinement plumbing. Test: a non-BMP string round-trips
  through `length`/`substring`/`indexOf`/`take`/`drop` on both tracks (`StringOperationsIntegrationTest`), and
  `Unicode.els` now carries a supplementary character.

  Two leaves outside the index family had to move with it, because they are documented in the *unit*: `split("", s)`
  is "the characters of `s`", and `replace("", r, s)` inserts "between every pair of characters". Java cuts both at
  UTF-16 boundaries, which would have split a surrogate pair now that a character is a code point, so the empty
  separator cuts at `(?s)(?<=.)` and the empty target fills `(?s)(?<=.)|^` instead. Behaviour on BMP text is
  unchanged, character for character.

  The **unit is now stated once**, on `type String` in `lang` (the layer that owns the name), and `length`,
  `substring`, `take`, `drop`, `indexOf` and `split` refer to it rather than restating it. `String.els`'s old sentence
  — "the platform's storage units" — is what S1's doc-comment change was going to have to contradict; it is gone.
- **S1 — the slot** — **LANDED**. `type String {size: Interval[BigInteger]}` + the `eliot.compiler.Meta` import,
  on the **stdlib** declaration of `String` (the layer that owns the refinement domain — `Bound`/`Interval` live there,
  and `Int`'s slot sets the precedent). The unit sentence went on the **lang** declaration instead, where `String`'s doc
  comment already lives and S0 already stated the unit: a name declared in two layers may carry a doc comment on only
  one of them. Inert on its own, exactly as predicted: no seed, so every node stayed ⊤ and the example sweep was clean.
- **S2 — the seed** — **LANDED**. `Runtime::stringLiteral`, `WellKnownTypes.stringLiteralFQN`, the channel arm, and the
  LSP `boundsOf` gate (§3.3). Tests: `StringSizeIntegrationTest` (accept/reject, the ⊤ fail-safe, a demand inside a
  parametered def, and the two code-point cases), `TypeHintRangeCompileTest` for the hover gate, and `StringSize.els`
  as a worked example. All 39 pre-existing example jars are byte-identical to master, so the domain is additive to
  codegen as §4.1 claimed.
- **S3 — the backend result-edge re-encode** (§8), landing together with the first stated transfer, `length`'s
  `{size(s)}`. Test: the §4.4 program compiles **and runs**, plus a `javap` check that the narrow conversion is
  emitted.
- **S4 — the remaining `String.els` transfers** (§6), each with its bound argued in the doc comment. Stop at the
  leaves that have an honest bound; leave the input leaves unstated and ⊤. Includes the compile-time `pow` leaf that
  `parseIntInternal`'s bound needs.
- **S5 — decide ⊤** (open `Interval` endpoints or a stated platform max), then arm R2 (§7). This is where the
  original TODO — *"a native that produces a meta-carrying type must state its meta-information"* — actually closes,
  for both domains at once. It is also the gate on **any second slot** in any domain (§5.3).

`List`/`Array` size (structural meta) and the meta interpretation (P4) stay out; S1–S4 is a complete, useful feature
without either.

## 11. Decisions needed before code

All settled; kept as the record of what was chosen and why.

1. ~~**Slot name `size`**~~ — **decided: `size`** (§3.2). The `Qualifier.Meta` accessor-namespace fix stays a follow-on,
   owed to `List` rather than to `String`.
2. ~~**Unit**~~ — **decided: the code-point count** (§5.1), with the index family switching units alongside `length`
   in a prerequisite change (S0). Two consequences settled with it: **byte size is not a slot** (§5.2, a backend
   derivation on the `Int`-range/width precedent), and **no second slot before S5** (§5.3).
3. **Backend option (1)** for the result edge (§8) — still owed, and still the recommendation, but it is now S3's
   decision rather than a precondition of the domain: with no transfer stated, the gap cannot fire (§4.1, re-verified
   by the byte-identical jar sweep). (2) remains the tempting cheap answer that guts the feature.
4. ~~**Scope**~~ — **decided: S1+S2**, the working `where` domain with no stated transfers, which is what landed.
5. ~~**Order vs. R2**~~ — **decided: the domain landed first, R2 stays dormant** (§7). The dozen-odd `String`-returning
   leaves that R2 will demand a transfer from are now on its list; they get stated once, in S4, rather than twice.
6. ~~**Is S0 in scope for whoever takes this?**~~ — **settled by landing it first** (§10). It went in as its own
   change, ahead of the slot and with no channel code touched, exactly as §5.1 recommended: landing the domain on the
   pragmatic unit and switching later was never a safe fallback, because every `where` written in the meantime would
   silently change meaning.

**The next stage is S3**, and it is now the gate on everything the domain is *for*: until the backend re-encodes on a
call's result edge, `length` cannot state `{size(s)}`, and without that first transfer a string's size never reaches
the `Int` domain (§4.4) and never crosses a call boundary at all.

---

## 12. Non-goals

- Structural/functorial meta types — still the `List`/`Array` domain's project.
- The meta interpretation (P4): bodied values keep deriving nothing.
- Any narrowing of `String` *representation* on the JVM (there is none to pick); the layout payoff is an MCU
  backend's, not this change's.
- A **byte-size slot** (§5.2). Byte count is a backend derivation from `size` plus the target's encoding, exactly as
  an `Int`'s machine width is derived from its `range` rather than carried beside it. The base layer names neither.
- An **encoding-claim slot** (`ascii ⊑ latin1 ⊑ unicode`, §5.3) — the second slot most likely to earn itself, and the
  first non-`Interval` domain, but gated on S5 like any second slot.
- Changing what `length` counts is **no longer a non-goal**: §5.1 decides it, and S0 makes it a prerequisite of this
  feature rather than something it must work around.
