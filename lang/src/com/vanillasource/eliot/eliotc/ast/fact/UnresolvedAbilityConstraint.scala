/** One `~` ability constraint on a generic binder, **before** its ability name is resolved — the ast and core
  * spelling of [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.resolve.fact.AbilityConstraint]].
  *
  * It is parametric in the phase's expression type exactly as [[EffectRow]] is parametric in the constraint type, so
  * the ast→core hop is a `map` rather than a second case class: `E` is `Sourced[Expression]` at ast (positions still
  * attached to every argument) and `com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.core.fact.Expression` at core.
  *
  * @param combinedBy
  *   The infix operator that joined this constraint to the one before it — `None` for the first of a list, and for
  *   every constraint the `{E}` effect-row sugar mints (nothing wrote an operator for those). It is kept as the name
  *   the user typed, not as a recognised symbol:
  *   [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.resolve.processor.ValueResolver]] resolves it through the ordinary dictionary and
  *   requires the standard library's combinator
  *   ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.module.fact.WellKnownTypes.abilityCombinatorFQN]]). That it lives on *this*
  *   type and not on the resolved one is what makes "no phase past resolve knows a combinator existed"
  *   (`docs/effects-syntax-userspace.md` §4 stage 1) a property of the model rather than a convention.
