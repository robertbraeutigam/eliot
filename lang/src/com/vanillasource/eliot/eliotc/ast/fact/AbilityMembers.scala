/** Lowers an `ability` or an `effect` block into ordinary [[FunctionDefinition]]s — one per member, plus the block's
  * synthetic **marker**. The two declarations lower identically (`docs/effects.md` §9.3: "a member's row lists what it
  * performs beyond the ability it belongs to — for `effect` and `ability` alike"); they differ in exactly one thing,
  * `performsItself`, and that difference is metadata, not shape.
  *
  * Effects v6 adds one binder. The block mints, **ahead of** its own generic parameters, a **binding binder** of kind
  * `Type`: the implementation slot, and the *first ability-level type argument* of every member reference, which is the
  * contract [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.ImplementationBinding]] reads back and
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.AbilityResolver]] slices off. So `effect Console` declares
  * `Console[Impl]` and `effect Throw[E]` declares `Throw[Impl, E]`.
  *
  * It goes first because a type-argument list applies positionally and the write is a prefix write: an ordinary
  * ability call (`show(x)`, `a ++ b`, `sort(xs)`) has its pattern arguments *inferred*, and no declaration determines
  * them, so a binding behind them could never be written at all. First, the write is one element long and everything
  * after it is inferred exactly as before. See `ImplementationBinding` for why this reverses §10.1 step 6.
  *
  * The binder is *not* `inferable`: it is always written by the `row` phase, never inferred. It is flagged
  * [[GenericParameter.abilityLevel]], as are the block's own parameters, so
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.core.processor.EffectSugarDesugarer]] knows to mint a member's *own* phantom
  * binders after it rather than in front of the ability's.
  *
  * The implementation side is unchanged: an `implement` marker still takes one argument per *pattern* element and no
  * binding, which is exactly what the two-site search matches against once the binding is sliced off.

object AbilityMembers {

  /** @param performsItself
    *   True for an `effect`: membership in the block says the member performs the effect, so the row is recorded on
    *   every member — the one place effect-ness is written down, and what the scope check and the write then read. An
    *   `ability`'s members declare nothing of the sort, which is what makes a constructor class expressible (§3.6).
