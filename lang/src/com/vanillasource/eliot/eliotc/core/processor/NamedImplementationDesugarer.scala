/** Lowers a **named** `implement` (effects v6, `docs/effects.md` §9.3) into ordinary [[FunctionDefinition]]s, the way
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.ImplementBlock]] lowers the anonymous form — with one addition.
  *
  * {{{
  * implement recordingConsole: Console {
  *    def printLine(s: String): {Writer[String]} Unit = tell(s ++ ";")
  *    def readLine: Option[String] = None
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * yields three kinds of value:
  *
  *   - one **method** per clause, in the implementation's namespace `Qualifier.AbilityImplementation(ability, pattern,
  *     Some(name))` — the same shape an anonymous `implement` produces, distinguished from it (and from every other
  *     named implementation of the same pattern) by the name component alone. Under v6 every implementation of a
  *     nullary effect shares the empty pattern, which is precisely why the name is part of the identity (§10.1 step 6).
  *   - the implementation's **marker**, the member whose local name is the ability's — what
  *     [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.ImplementationBinding]] recognises as a binding, and what a
  *     phantom binder carries at a reference. It takes one argument per pattern element, exactly as the anonymous
  *     form's does. Its return slot carries the guard, and a named implementation has none: it is never searched and
  *     never checked for overlap (§9.3), so the slot is the unguarded `true`.
  *   - the implementation's **name marker**, `QualifiedName(name, Qualifier.Implementation(name))` — a body-less type
  *     declaration that exists only to make `with name` a keyed dictionary lookup
  *     ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.resolve.processor.ValueResolverScope.getImplementation]]), mirroring the
  *     ability marker `Foo^Ability(Foo)` that makes an ability name resolve like any other name. The marker above
  *     cannot serve that role: its qualified name needs the ability name and the pattern key, neither of which the
  *     surface `with recordingConsole` supplies. The resolver maps the name marker to the real marker through its
  *     module's [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.module.fact.ModuleAbilities.markerOfImplementationName]], and only the
  *     real marker flows onward.
  *
  * A named implementation is always public: it exists to be named from elsewhere.
