/** Desugars the effect-row sugar `{ E1, E2, … } A` ([[Expression.EffectfulType]]) — effects v6, `docs/effects.md` §9.4
  * step 2.
  *
  * There is no carrier. A row entry and a `~` ability constraint each become **one phantom generic binder**: a binder
  * of kind `Type` that occurs in the generic list and in no parameter or return type, so rows still never flow into
  * types (§3.3). Its *value*, written at every reference by the `row` phase (§9.4 step 3), is an implementation —
  * either one a `with` names, or the `Default` sentinel asking for the two-site search.
  *
  * Three rewrites, and nothing else:
  *
  *   - **the return row vanishes.** `def greeting(name: String): {Console} Unit` becomes `def greeting[Impl](name:
  *     String): Unit`, with `Impl` carrying the constraint `Console[Impl]` — exactly the shape the carrier binder had,
  *     at kind `Type` instead of `Type -> Type`.
  *   - **a `~` constraint grows a binder.** `def sort[T ~ Ord[T]](xs: List[T])` becomes `def sort[Impl, T ~ Ord[Impl,
  *     T]](xs: List[T])`. The constraint stays on the binder it was written on — that is what
  *     `resolveParamConstraints` and the superability closure read — and only gains the binding as its **first** type
  *     argument, which is where the ability's marker declares it
  *     ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.AbilityMembers]]) and where
  *     [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.ImplementationBinding]] reads it back. Constraint and
  *     marker must agree on the position: a reference's ability-level arguments are matched against the marker's
  *     parameters, so appending here while the marker prepends made every dispatch query the wrong shape.
  *   - **a top-level row in a parameter or a `data` field thunks.** `computation: {Throw[E]} A` becomes `computation:
  *     Unit => A`: a slot that must not run its argument says so by being a function, since there is no carrier left
  *     to hold an unrun computation. Only a *top-level* row thunks; a row in an arrow codomain (`onError: E => {} A`)
  *     is the callback's own row and lowers to the bare payload, exactly as a return row does.
  *
  * **Every minted binder carries the mark** as its declared type — `Impl: Implementation[Console]`,
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.GenericParameter.implementationMark]] — which is the one place the fact
  * "this binder is a binding" is written down, and what [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.row.BindingWriter]] reads.
  * Minted binders are still *placed* together, but nothing requires them to be a prefix any more: the write merges
  * them by index.
  * [[mintAt]] places a member's own binders past the whole ability-level run, because the *ability's* binding must
  * stay the first of the ability-level type arguments ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.AbilityMembers]]).
  *
  * **Idempotent**, because [[CoreProcessor]] applies it uniformly to every definition including the ability members
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.AbilityMembers]] has already lowered: a definition with no remaining rows
  * and no unprocessed constraint is returned unchanged, and a constraint is "processed" once its first type argument
  * refers to one of this definition's **marked** binders — a shape only this desugar writes.
  *
  * A **pinned** row (`{E | T} A`) has no v6 meaning — there is no carrier stack to name — and is rejected by
  * [[rowErrors]] rather than silently read as an open row.
