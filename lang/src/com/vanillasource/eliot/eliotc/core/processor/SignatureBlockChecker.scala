/** Rejects a `{ … }` block anywhere in a value's **signature**, with a located error.
  *
  * `BlockDesugaringProcessor` lowers blocks in a value's *runtime body* and nowhere else, so a block written in a type
  * position survived un-lowered all the way to match desugaring and took the compiler down with
  * `IllegalStateException: BlockExpression should not exist after block desugaring`. The shape that reaches it in
  * practice is an effect row written where no row may go:
  *
  * {{{
  * def gathered: List[{Console} Unit] = empty
  * }}}
  *
  * A type argument is parsed by the *value* expression parser (types are values), where a leading `{` is always a
  * block — so `{Console}` is read as a block and juxtaposed with `Unit`, and the effect-row parser never sees it.
  *
  * **It is reported rather than lowered, and that is the point.** Desugaring signatures too would make this compile:
  * `{Console} Unit` would lower to the immediately-applied lambda `(_ -> Unit)(Console)`, which evaluates to `Unit`,
  * so `List[{Console} Unit]` would silently mean `List[Unit]` — an effect annotation quietly discarded. A row belongs
  * on a definition's return type or on a parameter or field type, where the desugar gives it a meaning
  * ([[EffectSugarDesugarer]]); anywhere else there is no binding site for it, and saying so is the only fail-safe
  * answer (`docs/effects.md` §5 rule 8).
