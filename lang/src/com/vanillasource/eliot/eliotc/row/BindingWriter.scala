/** **The write** — effects v6, `docs/effects.md` §9.4 step 3. Rewrites one definition so that every reference carries
  * the implementation each of the callee's **phantom binders** stands for.
  *
  * It replaces `RowElaborator`. There is no carrier to solve for, so there is no `flatMap` to hoist, no `pure` or
  * `runId` to insert and no discharge stack to derive: an operation call is an ordinary call, and the only thing
  * missing from it is which implementation it runs on. Three jobs, one walk:
  *
  *   1. **write the bindings.** At each reference the callee's phantom binders are read off its declaration, and each
  *      is given a value by the resolution order below, as a leading positional prefix. A binder is never left to a
  *      metavariable.
  *   2. **thunk and apply.** A row-typed slot lowered to `Unit => A` (§9.4 step 2), so an actual delivered there is
  *      wrapped in a lambda, and a reference to one of *this* definition's row-typed parameters is applied to `unit`.
  *      Doing both unconditionally is what makes a pass-through (`runAbort(computation)`,
  *      `foldOption(fallback, …)`, `val restFailures = rest`) come out right with no inspection of the argument's
  *      shape or type: wrap and apply are inverse, so a pass-through is an η-expansion and nothing more.
  *   3. **erase `with`.** The node exists to put a binding in scope for its subject; once the subject's references
  *      carry it, it is dropped — from a body, and from a slot's type in the signature.
  *
  * **Where a binding comes from — the resolution order** (§9.4), walking outward lexically:
  *
  *   1. the nearest enclosing `with` for that ability;
  *   2. this definition's own phantom binder for it — a *received* binding, filled by its caller. There is no graph to
  *      sum: forwarding is the enclosing signature, read once;
  *   3. for an actual at a row-typed slot, the entries that slot **supplies** — bound by the slot's own `with`, or by
  *      `Default` with none. An entry the callee's own declared row already has is *not* supplied, and the walk
  *      continues outward (Part I's supplied-versus-rides rule, §2.2, unchanged);
  *   4. `Default` — "search at the ground arguments", today's two-site resolution — for an ordinary **ability**. For
  *      an **effect** there is no default: an uncovered one is the "performs but does not declare" error, reported
  *      here at the reference, because this walk is exactly the scope check's walk.
  *
  * **Effect-ness is read from one place only**: the callee's declared row. An ability appearing in
  * `effectRow.returnEffects` is an effect at this reference — which for an `effect`'s member is what membership
  * recorded ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.ast.fact.AbilityMembers]]) and for an ordinary definition is what its
  * `{ … }` says. A `~` constraint's ability is in no row, so it defaults. Nothing keys on a name or a shape.
  *
  * The walk crosses a lambda boundary iff the lambda's slot has a row (D5, §9.4): a lambda at a rowless arrow may bind
  * and discharge locally but never reaches the enclosing declarations. That falls out of the walk rather than being a
  * rule of its own — a rowless slot is not entered with a slot scope, and a lambda's own parameter shadows a thunk of
  * the same name.
