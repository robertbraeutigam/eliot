/** Effects v6's **write** phase (`docs/effects.md` §9.4 step 3): every reference in a demanded value's runtime body is
  * given the implementation each of its callee's phantom binders stands for, every row-typed slot is thunked, and
  * every `with` is consumed. See [[BindingWriter]] for the rules; this processor only supplies the declared world it
  * needs and reports what it could not answer.
  *
  * Placed after [[RecursionCheckedValue]] (the recursion gate walks the *user's* reference graph) and before
  * `SaturatedValueProcessor`, so everything from saturation onwards sees written bodies and signatures with no `with`
  * left in them. A value that is not [[RowChecker.checkable]] — body-less, a `@Signature` twin, a type constructor or
  * a meta companion — is carried through unchanged.
  *
  * **The universe is built by demand, not guessed.** The write is decision-free but not context-free: it consults the
  * declared signature, declared row and slot rows of every callee it meets, and the resolved qualifier of every
  * implementation a `with` names. Which names those are cannot be read off the body alone. So the write runs against
  * a [[RowChecker.Universe]] that *reports* every name it misses, fetches exactly those, and repeats until a round
  * misses nothing new; the last round's universe is complete for this value by construction.
  *
  * @param runBoundaryFunctions
  *   The platform-contributed values at which every effect's chain ends ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.row.RunBoundaryFunctions]]) —
  *   the synthesized entry point. Only the platform knows which value that is.
  *
  * The fetch is [[getFactIfProduced]] by design: a referenced name legitimately has no [[OperatorResolvedValue]] when
  * its own definition aborted upstream, and a reference the write cannot read is simply left alone — the fail-safe
  * direction, since an unwritten binder is caught by the checker rather than silently defaulted.
