/** Generates file stats for a given file. This processor never fails.
  *
  * An mtime identifies a file's content only once it can no longer move without being seen. Stat the file at `T` and
  * read mtime `M`; a later modification at `W > T` gets mtime `floor(W) >= floor(T)`, so it can only reproduce `M` if
  * `M` falls in the same tick as `T`. Hence: **if `M` lies a full tick before `T`, every later modification is
  * visible**, and comparing on the mtime alone is conclusive. Inside that window it is not, and the stat says so by
  * carrying its own observation instant (see [[FileStat.unsettled]]).
  *
  * Two details are load-bearing:
  *   - **the clock is read before the stat**, so `now <= T`. Soundness needs `M + margin <= T`; a clock read *after*
  *     the stat gives `now >= T`, which does not imply it. It reads like a harmless reordering and is not one.
  *   - **[[FileStatProcessor.defaultSettleMargin]] must dominate the filesystem's tick plus any skew between its clock
  *     and this JVM's.** Measured on the development machine: a 4.00 ms tick (the kernel's, not the API's — nanosecond
  *     timestamps are stamped at that same tick and buy nothing) and 4–5 ms of skew. The default sits three orders of
  *     magnitude above both, because being wrong here compiles stale source, while being conservative only costs a
  *     re-read of a file written in the last two seconds.
