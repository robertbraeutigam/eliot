/** Resolves the `h` of a `with h` to the implementation it names — effects v6's resolution step (`docs/effects.md` §9.4
  * step 1). The answer is the implementation's **marker**
  * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.ImplementationBinding]]'s head), which is the only thing that
  * flows onward: a name is never carried downstream to be searched by, because such a name would ignore import scope,
  * could not be shadowed, and would be decided by hash order (§12).
  *
  * Two keyed steps, no scan: first the implementation's **name marker** in the ordinary dictionary
  * ([[ValueResolverScope.getImplementation]]), which is what makes the lookup honour imports and shadowing exactly as
  * an ability name's does — and which names the module the implementation lives in; then that module's
  * [[ModuleAbilities.markerOfImplementationName]], which is the implementation's real marker.
  *
  * The second step exists because a marker's qualified name also carries the ability name and the pattern key, and
  * `with h` supplies neither. A name that resolves to no implementation is a hard error at the `with` — never a silent
  * fall-back to the default, which would make a mistyped fake silently run the real thing.
