    * type-argument slot unification never solved (e.g. an effect-carrier error slot `?E` that junk-grounded before the
    * `Throw` self-lift's `where E1 != E2` guard is reduced). Reducing the guard over that junk silently *selects* an
    * instance on a nonsense comparison (`Type != String` ⤳ the lift), which surfaces three steps later as a cryptic
    * unresolved carrier. So a guarded candidate whose operands include the defaulted universe is **declined** rather
    * than discharged — resolution falls through to `NoImplementation`, which the demanding use site reports *located*
    * (never a silent wrong instance choice). No legitimate guard compares the universe (the `Throw`/`Dep` self-lifts
    * compare error/key types; `Coerce`/`InRange` compare numbers), so this only ever fires on genuine junk. This is the
    * §7-independent mitigation the join-solver rewire (step 4) leans on: if that rewire ever junk-grounds a carrier
