/** Checks, for a given `(module, abilityName)` pair, that no two *unguarded* implementations of that ability in that
  * module have structurally overlapping patterns.
  *
  * Runs at definition time — as soon as any call site triggers ability resolution for this ability — so overlap errors
  * point at the offending implementations rather than at call sites that merely expose the ambiguity.
  *
  * Since ability-guards (§3.2) this is a **conservative lint, not the soundness mechanism**: the real coherence rule is
  * "exactly one candidate survives at every manifest use site", enforced by the use-site discharge + ambiguity check in
  * `AbilityImplementationProcessor`. Guard disjointness (`∀x. ¬(g₁(x) ∧ g₂(x))`) is undecidable, so a `where` guard on
  * either impl makes the pair *undecided* here and it is deferred silently to the use site — only two provably
  * overlapping *unguarded* impls are rejected at definition time (exactly the pre-guards behaviour).
  *
  * Cross-module overlap is likewise detected only at call time by the ambiguity check in
  * `AbilityImplementationProcessor`: the definition-time check here can only see impls in one module at a time, whereas
  * impls can legitimately live in either the ability's module or a type's module.
