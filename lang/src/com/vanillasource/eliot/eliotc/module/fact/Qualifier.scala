    * layers (abstract signatures in the base, bodies in a platform layer) and merged like any other name, and it keeps
    * two genuinely distinct instances of one ability in a module (e.g. `Eq[Type]` vs `Eq[String]`, or a guarded
    * instance whose `where` clause is part of its identity) apart. The pattern is *also* recoverable from the synthetic
    * marker function's signature;
    * this key is that same information, lifted into the name so the merge and dispatch can compare it directly.
