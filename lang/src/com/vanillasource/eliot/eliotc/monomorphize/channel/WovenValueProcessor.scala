/** The **`WovenValue` codegen seam** — the step between checking and code generation that everything downstream (`used`
  * / `uncurry` / the jvm backend) reads instead of [[MonomorphicValue]].
  *
  * Since effects v6 it *rewrites* nothing. The Id-normalization it was built for — erasing the identity carrier `Id`
  * and the `pure`/`flatMap`/`runId` machinery the elaborator wrote at pure boundaries — has no subject: there is no
  * carrier, so no machinery is inserted and no pure code pays for one. What is left is the seam's other job, which is
  * to be the place three **preconditions** are checked before any bytecode is emitted:
  *
  *   - **supplied row arguments** — every supplied row entry at every call knows what it supplies
  *     ([[SuppliedRowArgumentsProcessor]]);
  *   - **meta-transfer accounting** — a native leaf producing a meta-carrying type states what it does to it
  *     ([[MetaTransferAccountingProcessor]]);
  *   - **the woven re-check** — the body is type-checked once more on ground types, with no metavariables and no
  *     unification ([[WovenRecheck]]).
  *
  * Each is mandatory rather than advisory: a machine-generated core that nothing re-checks is exactly the
  * silent-miscompile surface the fail-safe rule forbids.
