/** **The meta interpretation** (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §6.2 / P4) — the answer to the one question *"what is
  * this value's meta-information?"*, and the place the closure invariant of §2 is actually executed:
  *
  *   - a **leaf states** its transfer, so its meta is its `^Meta` companion reduced on the argument metas;
  *   - **everything else derives**, so its meta is obtained by *interpreting its own body* with its parameters bound to
  *     the caller's argument metas.
  *
  * Those are R2 and R3 read as a definition rather than as a prohibition, which is why [[metaOf]] is a two-armed `ifM`
  * on exactly the test [[MetaTransferAccountingProcessor]] enforces. Before this existed only the first arm did: a call
  * to a bodied callee was a ⊤ boundary, so precision was a property of *where code sits relative to a native* rather
  * than of what the code *is* — `def label(s: String): String = s` lost its argument's size, and `String::show`
  * (bodied, therefore forbidden to state) derived nothing at all.
  *
  * **This is Option B of §6, not Option A.** No shadow twin program is emitted: the interpretation walks the very
  * monomorphized body the representation pass will stamp, so node correspondence is free. The stated transfers it
  * bottoms out at stay ordinary Eliot reduced by the one NbE evaluator ([[EscalatingReducer]]), so the single-evaluator
  * cornerstone is intact — this adds a *walk*, not a second evaluator.
  *
  * **What it computes and what it does not.** This object answers only *what the meta is*. It records nothing, demands
  * no `where`, and reports no diagnostic: which nodes may be *stamped* with a meta is representation policy and stays
  * with [[RefinementChannelProcessor]]'s walk, whose records are keyed by source position **in the value being
  * walked**. A derived meta is therefore consumed at the **call node in the caller** and nowhere else — the callee's
  * own body is laid out once, conservatively, from its own table at ⊤ parameters (§7: "get that wrong and it arrives as
  * a `ClassCastException`, not a type error"). Interpreting a callee's body here never records into its table and never
  * re-demands its preconditions; both are made once, at the definition.
  *
  * **Termination is the recursion gate's** (§2.3): user code cannot express recursion, so the derivation walks a DAG
  * and needs no fixpoint, no widening and no ascending-chain condition. The [[interpretationBudget]] is therefore not
  * what makes this terminate — it is the §8.4 fail-safe against *cost*: a diamond-shaped call DAG re-interpreted per
  * path is exponential even though each path is acyclic. The budget is a step count threaded through the whole
  * derivation of one call node, and exhausting it yields **absence**, which is sound ("I know nothing" is always true)
  * and never a wrong answer.
  *
  * **First-order for now.** A lambda is a function value and carries no meta of its own here, so a callee that applies
  * one of its own parameters (`foldLeft`'s `combine`, `Function::apply`) still yields ⊤ — the higher-order rows of §5,
  * which additionally wait on the `List` size domain for anything to iterate over. An *applied* lambda is interpreted,
  * since that is what a pure `val` block lowers to (`(x -> rest)(e)`) and its binding is ordinary parameter binding.
