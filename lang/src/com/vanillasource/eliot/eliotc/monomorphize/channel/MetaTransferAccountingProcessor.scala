/** **R2 + R3 enforcement** (docs/total-meta-transfers.md §2/§3/§P2/§P3) — the two halves of *"every named value has a
  * meta transfer, and exactly one way of having it"*:
  *
  *   - **R2 — a leaf must state.** Every **body-less** value — a native leaf — that produces a meta-carrying type must
  *     **state** its meta transfer. Without it, a native returning e.g. `Int` (whose value range is meta-information)
  *     and carrying no `{ ... }` transfer brace silently defaults its meta to ⊤ rather than being forced to say what it
  *     does. This closed the TODO *"A native that produces a meta-carrying type must state its meta-information"*.
  *   - **R3 — nothing else may state.** A **bodied** value **derives** its transfer from that body, so a brace on it is
  *     an error. Deriving is the meta-interpretation slice (§6.2/§P4) and does not exist yet, but the prohibition does
  *     not wait for it: a brace on a bodied value is read by `RefinementChannelProcessor.metaViaCompanion` *instead of*
  *     the body, so it is a stated summary silently overriding what the code actually does — the one shape in which the
  *     channel can be wrong rather than merely imprecise.
  *
  * A rider on [[MonomorphicValue]] (runtime track), on the [[EffectAccountingProcessor]] template. The leaf test both
  * rules split on is exactly the body test the fact already carries — `mv.runtime.isEmpty` (no Eliot body on this
  * track), read *after* the layer merge, so §8.2's cross-layer case (the brace in one layer, the body in another) is
  * the same check and needs no separate mechanism.
  *
  * R2's return-meta test uses the value's **declared** (pre-monomorphization) return type ([[OperatorResolvedValue]]),
  * so the origination is distinguished from the pass-through:
  *
  *   - a **concrete return head** (`String::length : Int`) originates the meta — the leaf must state a `^Meta` transfer
  *     for it, or it is a compile error at the leaf;
  *   - a **type-parameter return head** (`foldLeftInternal[F[_], A, B] : F[B]`, `runId[A] : A`) does not originate a
  *     meta — it forwards whatever its argument/instantiation carries — so it is **exempt**. Deriving such a
  *     (higher-order) transfer is the meta-interpretation slice (§6.2/§P4), not this one.
  *
  * R3 needs no such test: a brace is illegal on a bodied value whatever it returns.
  *
  * The check is normatively **use-site, post-mono** (§4): whether a return's meta is `Unit` is a per-instantiation fact,
  * so it rides each `MonomorphicValue`. The fact is produced only when both checks pass; a violation aborts, and that
  * abort is a [[WovenValue]] `getFactOrAbort` precondition (S5's arming step), so a violating value blocks its own
  * codegen — a silently-defaulted or silently-overridden meta never reaches bytecode.
