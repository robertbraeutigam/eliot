/** Every **supplied** row entry at every call in a monomorphic body must know what it supplies (`docs/effects.md`
  * §2.2) — a rider on [[MonomorphicValue]] built on the [[MetaTransferAccountingProcessor]] template, and a codegen
  * precondition through [[WovenValueProcessor]]'s `getFactOrAbort`.
  *
  * A parameter row lowers to a thunk (`{Throw[E]} A` ⤳ `Unit -> A`, `docs/effects.md` §3.1 step 2), which erases the
  * entry's own arguments from the *type*. Where nothing else determines them — `catch[E, A](computation:
  * {Throw[E]} A, onError: E => {} A)` called with a handler that ignores its error — `E` is left to default, and the
  * default is the universe. The call then compiles and the per-instantiation frames silently disagree: the discharger
  * installs a frame keyed on the universe while the `raise` inside exits one keyed on the real error type, so the exit
  * unwinds past every frame and reaches the runtime as a bare exception.
  *
  * That is a program that compiles and crashes, which nothing may be. So a defaulted argument at a supplied row entry
  * is **rejected here**, at the call, before any bytecode is emitted.
  *
  * The ordinary case is gone: the write takes the entry's arguments from the actual's own declared row
  * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.row.BindingWriter.suppliedDetermination]]), so `bad catch (err -> "fallback")`
  * comes out with `E := String` written. What is left for this check is what no declaration answers — chiefly an
  * *over-discharge*, a second `catch` over a computation the first already discharged, where the actual declares no
  * row at all. That is a meaningless program rather than a gap, and it is rejected at the call naming the fix.
  *
  * '''This is not an effect verifier''' (D7, `docs/effects.md` §11). Until the D7 decision this processor also
  * re-derived each instance's effect row post-monomorphization and checked `derived ⊆ declared`. The trace that
  * decision asked for measured what that could see — a reference *forwarding a received binding to a callee that
  * declares the ability*, never a direct operation call, whose row `AbilityResolver` has already rewritten away —
  * making it a strict subset of what the pre-mono scope check ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.row.BindingWriter]])
  * reports at the reference, with no case of its own. It is retired; the effects channel has one verifier, and it is
  * that scope check, complete before monomorphization. What is left here is not its shadow.
