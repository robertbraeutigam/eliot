/** The refinement channel's **flow analysis** — Step 6-iii of `docs/bounds-as-refinements.md` ("narrow representations
  * from the channel's flow analysis"). Post-flag-day (Step 6-ii) `Int` has lost its type parameters, so a node's value
  * range is no longer in its type; the channel *computes* it by flow and records it into a [[RefinementTable]], keyed by
  * source position. The reconcile pass ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.reconcile.processor.ReconcileProcessor]]) then
  * stamps those intervals onto the body as per-node metas, and the JVM backend decodes each `Int`'s machine layout from
  * its meta (a narrow wrapper instead of the ⊤/bignum fallback).
  *
  * A post-pass over each [[MonomorphicValue]] (runtime track): it walks the fully-ground body bottom-up and, for every
  * node whose value range it can pin, records that interval. The propagation rules (the value channel of §4):
  *
  *   - **α (literal seeding):** a literal seeds the singleton range it knows about itself — an integer literal `n` its
  *     value `[n, n]`, a string literal the size `[k, k]` of its `k` code points. Both go through the *same* path (the
  *     literal protocol's own `^Meta` companion in `eliot.lang.Runtime`), so the second domain needed no second
  *     mechanism — only its own seed declaration.
  *   - **Calls:** a call's result is the callee's meta, asked for by [[MetaInterpreter.metaOfCall]] — **stated** by a
  *     leaf (an `Int` `+`/`-`/`*`'s `add^Meta`/…; `fold`'s merge companion `join(whenTrue, whenFalse)`, mechanically
  *     identical to a transfer, so no branch construct is ever named) or **derived** by interpreting a bodied callee's
  *     own body under these argument metas. Which of the two applies is the callee's business, not this walk's — that
  *     is the state-or-derive closure of `docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §2, and this walk names neither a native leaf
  *     nor a branch construct to tell them apart.
  *
  * Everything else is ⊤ (unknown, laid out as a bignum) — a parameter, the body of a lambda, a `match` (`handleCases`)
  * result, a call whose callee neither states nor can be interpreted (a higher-order one, §5's table). A ⊤ node is
  * still *recorded*, as a `None` verdict — see [[recordAt]] for why omitting it is unsound at an aliased position.
  *
  * **What this walk decides, and what it does not.** It decides *what may be stamped*: a record is keyed by source
  * position **in the value being walked**, so it is representation policy for this body and this body only
  * (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §7). *What the meta is* belongs to [[MetaInterpreter]], which computes metas
  * through call boundaries but records nothing and reports nothing. A derived meta is therefore consumed at the **call
  * node in the caller**; the callee's own layout stays joined and conservative, computed from its own table at ⊤
  * parameters.
  *
  * The walk **descends everywhere**: into the arguments of ordinary calls (so a literal/arithmetic argument narrows and
  * is reconciled to the callee's parameter representation at the call), into a lambda's body, and into the head of an
  * application the channel cannot recognise (an applied lambda — what a pure `val` block lowers to). Descending is what
  * makes the use-site `where` demand total; *recording* is the narrower privilege, and it stops at a lambda (a narrow
  * value returned through a lambda's `apply` bridge would fail its `CHECKCAST` — see the class note on
  * `LambdaGenerator`), which is why those two subtrees are walked for their checks and their records discarded.
  *
  * Why a post-pass and not a rider inside the checker: refinements are, by the design's held invariant, strictly
  * *downstream* of type formation (they flow into checks and codegen, never back into a type), so the channel can run
  * entirely over the checker's output with zero risk to the checker's invariants. See the design doc §3.
  *
  * A transfer and a merge are recognised the *same* way: solely by the callee declaring a `^Meta` companion
  * ([[metaCompanionFqn]]), never by naming a native leaf or a branch construct (`docs/generic-refinement-merges.md`).
  * The companion's body may itself route through ability instances (a transfer's `Numeric[Interval]`, a merge's
  * `Meta.join`); the post-monomorphize linker-executor
  * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.processor.EscalatingReducer]]) resolves those through each
  * instance's own monomorphization, so the former "a transfer must bottom out at natives" restriction is repealed
  * (`docs/refinement-channel-follow-ups.md`).
