      * reifies nothing: its body is two value lambdas and binds no type argument at all. Checker output nevertheless
      * carries every solved type argument, so the written `[BigInteger]` used to be β-applied to `start` — shifting each
      * value argument one to the left and reducing a well-typed definition to an ill-typed value
      * (`Interval(Bounded(BigInteger), Bounded(n), n)`), which no phase downstream is in a position to notice.
      *
      * The written arguments must still *stay in the spine*: for a bodied definition that does not unfold, the spine is
      * the type application the unifier decomposes and the printer renders. So the arguments are kept, and the ones the
      * body cannot bind are skipped only where they would do harm — when the body is unfolded
      * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.eval.Evaluator]] applies its `applySpine` rather than the raw
      * spine).

      * what gives it one), while a *type-level* body binds its own parameters and needs no wrap. Both end up as leading
      * [[VLam]]s, so the two are told apart by **name** — a type argument is β-applied only while the body's head lambda
      * is the generic binder it belongs to. `closed`'s head lambda is `start`, not `T`, which is exactly the mismatch.
