/** The per-track strategy for the two monomorphization tracks (runtime / compiler). It carries the track's [[Platform]]
  * (so fact keys read the platform off the track rather than a bare threaded value) plus the two places the checking
  * core genuinely differs between the two tracks, each extracted 1:1 from a former `platform match` conditional in
  * [[TypeStackLoop]]:
  *
  *   - [[implBindings]] — the compiler track's resolved-impl binding fetch, folded into the read-back evaluator's lookup
  *     (empty on the runtime track, whose body stays structural for codegen);
  *   - [[readBackBody]] — reduce the compile-time body ([[PostDrainQuoter.reduceSourced]]) on the compiler track, or
  *     keep it structural ([[PostDrainQuoter.quoteSourced]]) on the runtime track.
  *
  * The return-position settle is no longer a track hook: [[TypeStackLoop.settleAtRead]] reads the value's re-inflated
  * ground signature and settles it directly, branching on [[platform]] once for the guard's runtime-discharge vs
  * compiler-pass-through asymmetry (signature-unification C1). Everything else in the checking core is track-agnostic.
  * A hook receives exactly the collaborators / primitives it needs (the [[Checker]] for the two that call checker
  * methods, `fetchBinding` / the [[PostDrainQuoter]] for the read side); state access is via [[CheckIO]].
