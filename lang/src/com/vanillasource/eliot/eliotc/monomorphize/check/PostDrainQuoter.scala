/** Post-drain conversion of a [[SemExpression]] tree into a [[MonomorphicExpression]] tree.
  *
  * Every [[SemValue]] slot is quoted via [[Quoter.quote]] against the final metastore. Unresolved metas, neutrals,
  * lambdas, native applications, and unapplied top-level definitions surface as explicit `Cannot resolve type.`
  * compiler errors (with source positions taken from the enclosing expression / name) — there is no silent
  * `GroundValue.Type` fallback.
  *
  * Ability references (value refs whose qualifier is [[CoreQualifier.Ability]]) are rewritten using the pre-computed
  * [[abilityResolutions]] map: refs resolved during the drain loop emit the chosen impl's FQN and type args; refs
  * absent from the map (constraint-covered calls where the concrete impl lives at the caller's level) emit their
  * original ability FQN so downstream dispatch stays abstract.
  *
  * '''Compile→runtime reification (the staging gate).''' A value-position sub-term whose value is fully determined by
  * erased `[]`-bound parameters (e.g. `name(A)` projecting a field of an erased `A: Person`, or an erased `BigInteger`
  * bound referenced directly) has no runtime slot for those parameters, so it cannot be emitted structurally. Instead
  * it is a compile-time constant and is '''materialised''' into a literal / constructor-call tree. The quoter walks the
  * tree top-down threading an evaluation [[Env]] (ρ) seeded with the erased parameters (`monoEnv`) and extended with a
  * fresh neutral for each enclosing runtime lambda binder. For each node:
  *   - references no erased parameter ⟹ recurse structurally; nothing is ever evaluated, so ordinary runtime code
  *     (including recursive defs and large constants) is preserved verbatim and cannot diverge.
  *   - references an erased parameter together with a runtime parameter or an inner lambda ⟹ the erased dependence
  *     resolves deeper; recurse structurally into the children.
  *   - references an erased parameter and nothing runtime ⟹ evaluate, force, and read back. A fully-ground result
  *     materialises to a literal/constructor tree; a result that does not reduce to a materialisable constant (a
  *     partial application's closure, a still-abstract head) recurses into the children if the node is an application,
  *     or — at a leaf that genuinely depends on an erased parameter with no constant value — raises a fail-safe
  *     compiler error (never a silent bad emit of a runtime reference to an erased parameter).
