/** Immutable state for the bidirectional type checker.
  *
  * The checker keeps the **typing context Γ** and the **evaluation environment ρ** separate (the textbook NbE-checker
  * shape), instead of overloading one `Env` for both:
  *   - [[gamma]] (Γ) maps a parameter name to its **type** — read by [[Checker.infer]]'s `ParameterReference`.
  *   - [[rho]] (ρ) maps a parameter name to its **value** for the evaluator: an erased type parameter to its
  *     concrete value, a runtime value parameter to a **fresh neutral** standing for its not-yet-known runtime value
  *     (so a dependent type stays abstract in that parameter — genuine dependent Π), a peeled instantiation meta to the
  *     meta itself.
  *
  * The two grow in lockstep (every `bind*` extends both), so their de Bruijn levels stay in sync.
  *
  * Per-metavariable kind bookkeeping (which instantiation metas are higher-kinded, and to what kind) is **not** held
  * here as a separate side-table: it lives in the
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.unify.Unifier.higherKindedMetas]] map on the [[unifier]], and
  * [[recordHigherKindedMeta]] below delegates into it.
  *
  * @param gamma
  *   Γ: the typing context — parameter name → its type (de Bruijn level environment).
  * @param rho
  *   ρ: the evaluation environment — parameter name → its value (de Bruijn level environment); consumed by the
  *   [[Evaluator]].
  * @param unifier
  *   The unifier (carries meta store, depth, postponed, errors, and the per-meta role map)
  * @param bindingCache
  *   Cache of fetched NativeBinding SemValues, keyed by ValueFQN.
  * @param abilityResolutions
  *   Map from each ability-qualified value reference to its resolved concrete impl. Filled by the drain-resolution
  *   loop; absence means the ref stays abstract (constraint-covered) at quoting time.
  *
  * The key is [[CheckState.AbilityResolutionKey]] — the source-positioned FQN **and the ability-level type arguments
  * the impl was chosen for**. Both halves are load-bearing: the position+FQN is what the post-drain quoter can
  * re-derive while walking the tree, but it is *not* a node identity. Compiler-synthesized machinery inherits the span
  * of the expression it wraps ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.row.RowElaborator]]'s `pureWrap`/`bindNodes` build
  * their reference with `value.as(...)`), so one source expression wrapped at two carriers yields two `Effect::pure`
  * references with *identical* position and FQN and *different* carriers. Keyed by position alone they collapse to one
  * entry: the second reference is filtered out as "already resolved" and silently inherits the first one's impl — a
  * `pure@Effect[Id]` emitted as `pure@Effect[IO]`, which `IdNormalizer` then cannot erase, shipping an `IO` value into
  * a slot typed `Id[Unit]` (a `ClassCastException` at runtime, no diagnostic anywhere).
  *
  * @param abilityArities
  *   Ability-method FQN → its ability's arity (how many leading type arguments of a method reference belong to the
  *   ability rather than the method). Recorded by [[AbilityResolver]], which fetches it anyway to slice the impl query;
  *   read back by the post-drain quoter, which must slice a reference's type arguments the same way to rebuild the
  *   [[abilityResolutions]] key and has no `getFact` of its own.
  * @param ambientCarriers
  *   The value-under-check's own *ambient* effect-carrier heads: for each of its higher-kinded, ability-constrained
  *   signature binders (the M1 `{E...}` carrier, `[F[_] ~ E...]`), the forced head of the binder's value in ρ after
  *   type-argument application and instantiation — a [[CheckState.CarrierHead.TopDef]] for a concrete instantiation
  *   (`IO`), a [[CheckState.CarrierHead.Meta]] for a peeled one. Recorded once by [[TypeStackLoop]]; read by the
  *   checker-side effect lift (`isEffectCarrierHeaded`, the pure-wrap arm).
  * @param metaConstraints
  *   The ability constraints a callee reference declared on each of its freshly-peeled instantiation metas — keyed by
  *   the meta's raw id (docs/effects-as-channel.md §10 U4-f). Recorded at instantiation ([[recordMetaConstraints]],
  *   from [[CarrierKindChecker.recordCarrierMetas]]); read by the row-argument type-pinning rule when a constrained
  *   carrier meta needs its declared abilities looked up. Built once here.
