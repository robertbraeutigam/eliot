/** The ability-resolution *saturation* concern (a checker collaborator, symmetrical with `carriers` / `guards`):
  * discovering every ability-qualified value reference and resolving each to its concrete impl, factored out of the
  * [[TypeStackLoop]]'s post-drain fold. None of this is definitional equality: it re-enters `getFact` to read an
  * ability marker's arity, and it drives the `resolve-abilities` fixed-point pass.
  *
  * Two entry points, mirroring the two phases:
  *   - [[collectAbilityRefs]] — walk the checker's output trees to find every ability-qualified reference (called from
  *     `TypeStackLoop.processIO` to seed the pass context).
  *   - [[resolveAbilities]] — the `resolve-abilities` saturation pass body: try to resolve every still-unresolved
  *     reference once, recording each impl.
  *
  * The resolutions themselves live in the shared [[CheckState.abilityResolutions]] map — this module only *records*
  * into it. Operates over [[CheckIO]], reading and writing the shared [[CheckState]] through `get`/`modify`/`inspect`.
  * It depends on exactly the primitives passed at construction — that narrow surface is the module boundary.
  *
  * @param resolveAbility
  *   Resolve an ability at concrete type arguments to its impl — the checker's `resolveAbility`.
  * @param platform
  *   The track's platform, used to key the ability-marker signature fact.

    *   - Otherwise the ref's own type arguments are used.
    *   - Quoting failure (still-unsolved metas) leaves the ref pending for the next iteration.
    *   - The ground ability-level arguments may end in a **binding** ([[ImplementationBinding]], effects v6 §9.4 step
    *     4): an implementation named there is recorded **directly** — its method of this reference's name, at the
    *     binding's own type arguments — with no search, no `where` filter and no coherence question, since `with`
    *     *replaces* the search rather than parameterising it; the `Default` marker (and no binding at all, the whole
    *     tree today) goes to the two-site search at the pattern arguments. The resolution is keyed under the full
    *     sliced arguments, binding included, so one span referenced under two bindings records two entries — exactly
    *     as two carriers at one span do — and the post-drain quoter re-derives the same slice.
    *   - `resolveAbility` returning `None` at *ground* arguments is a failed **demand**: the [[AbilityImplementation]]
    *     fact's non-resolved outcome is read back and reported here, at this reference — the demand site — and the
    *     check aborts (see [[reportFailedDemand]]). Only an *absent* fact (the resolution aborted on an upstream error,
    *     already reported at its own definition) leaves the ref silently pending, to be emitted by [[PostDrainQuoter]]
    *     as an abstract reference.
