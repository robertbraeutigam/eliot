/** Pattern unification on SemValues with a postponement queue. All operations return a new Unifier instance — no
  * mutation occurs.
  *
  * @param metaStore
  *   The current meta store
  * @param depth
  *   The current binding depth (for fresh variable generation)
  * @param postponed
  *   Queue of postponed unification problems (when a meta's spine is not pattern)
  * @param errors
  *   Accumulated errors with source positions and (when available) the expected and actual semantic values.
  *
  * This is *pure definitional (value) equality* with metavariable solving on top: it forces both sides through the
  * evaluator (= normalises) and compares. There is no notion of "assignability" or directional widening here.
  * Directional coercion (e.g. an `Int[0,5]` used where an `Int[0,10]` is expected) is a separate concern handled
  * outside the unifier by a user-defined `Coerce` ability that the checker inserts in check mode.
  *
  * Per-metavariable metadata lives in [[metaRoles]] — one [[MetaRole]] per meta id (D2), the single map that
  * subsumes the former scattered side-sets. The combinable/candidates machinery supporting the Phase 4 `Combine`
  * ability is carried there: a metavariable in a covariant position (a `match` result, a result-position type
  * parameter) is marked [[MetaRole.Instantiation]] with `combinable = true`; when a *second, definitionally-unequal*
  * type is unified against such a meta, instead of failing the unification (first-candidate-wins) we accumulate it as
  * a candidate constraint and leave the meta solved to its first candidate. The checker later resolves these
  * candidates to their `Combine` join at drain time
  * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.Checker.resolveCombines]]). A meta is tainted (`combinable`
  * cleared) the moment it appears in a [[VPi]] domain — a contravariant position where joining would be unsound. When
  * no `Combine` instance applies (or the meta was tainted), the checker re-unifies the candidates strictly, surfacing
  * the ordinary mismatch — so unification stays first-candidate-wins for everything that has no `Combine` instance.
  *
  * @param metaRoles
  *   Per-meta-id role. Absence ⇒ [[MetaRole.Plain]]. The unifier reads/writes the [[MetaRole.Instantiation]] aspects
  *   during unification (combinable, candidates); the checker writes the carrier-kind / abstract-assoc / upper-bound /
  *   combine-resolved aspects through the role-transition methods below.

    *   - [[VNeutral]] — rigid bound variables with a spine.

    * `n < m` and non-rigid rhs shapes return `None`, leaving the caller to postpone. Cases like `?A [?B] ~
    * Function [Int, String]` have multiple valid solutions and correctly postpone. A [[VStuckNative]] head
