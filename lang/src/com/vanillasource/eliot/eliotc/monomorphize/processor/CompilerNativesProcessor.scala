/** The `compiler` native supplier: contributes the [[ContributedBinding]] under [[ContributedBinding.compilerLabel]] for
  * the compile-time reduction a name has in the **compiler** source pool.
  *
  * The compiler is itself a platform (the "compiler as a platform" plan, CP3). The compiler pool scans the runtime track
  * *completely* plus its own override overlay (the compiler-platform layer wins any redefinition, via
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.source.scan.PathScan.overrideFiles]] and `UnifiedModuleValueProcessor`), so this
  * contributor reads the value's own [[Platform.Compiler]]-marker
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.saturate.fact.SaturatedValue]] for *every* name reachable in the build. That marker
  * sees the overlay's redefinition where one exists (e.g. the compile-time `Either` carrier) and otherwise the
  * platform's own definition (e.g. jvm's `foldEither`): the compiler *borrows* a platform body when it is
  * compiler-runnable, which is how compile-time code reaches a function a platform codebase defines. It is registered as
  * a **native** label, so its reduction is preferred for checking while the runtime layer's body is still what
  * `TransparentBinding`/codegen reads (the `add` pattern — one name, two platform implementations, kept apart by the
  * marker).
  *
  * **Body vs. native — borrow is fail-safe.** [[BodyContributorProcessor]] contributes a `Body` for a body-ful value and
  * `None` for a body-less one (a native leaf, whose checking implementation is a native — never an empty binding that
  * would shadow a reducing native, the `add` bug). So a pure platform body (jvm's `foldEither`, an `Effect[IO]` method)
  * becomes a compile-time `Body` and reduces if forced, whereas a body that bottoms out in a bytecode leaf
  * (`nativeWiden`, `nativeAddByteToByte`) reduces only until it stalls on that leaf, surfacing a loud stuck term rather
  * than a silently wrong reduction, and a bare native leaf stays `None`.
  *
  * **Totality without spurious errors.** The [[BindingMergerProcessor]] consults this label for *every* name. A name is
  * asked about by membership first — does its module's [[Platform.Compiler]] [[UnifiedModuleNames]] declare it? — and
  * only a *member* triggers a [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.saturate.fact.SaturatedValue]] request. Because the
  * compiler pool now contains the runtime track, every name in the build is a member and resolves; membership is `false`
  * only for a genuinely absent name (a module in no layer of the compiler pool), answered the total `None` without
  * requesting (and thus without erroring on) its value. With only the abstract base on the compiler path (no platform,
  * no overlay) every name is body-less or absent, so this contributes `None` everywhere and changes no resolution.

    * the guard combinators `error`/`orError` — whose checking body performs ability dispatch (`raise`/`pure`) cannot be
    * reduced by the pure NbE evaluator against the abstract ability method (which has no binding), so its raw body would
    * stall on it. For such a value the compile-time reduction is the **compiler backend's** output — the
    * [[CompilerMonomorphicValue]] whose ability calls are resolved to the concrete impls and folded — built here into a
    * self-contained [[BindingContribution.Leaf]] ([[ReducedBindingClosure]]). Both tracks then get the reducible form:
    * the runtime track evaluates it in a type position (compiler-as-platform Increment E, the guard consumer), and the
    * compiler track inlines it when reducing another compile-time value (e.g. `error` inside `orError`).
    *
    * The gate is deliberately narrow. Reducing an ability-using value at compile time only makes sense for a genuine
    * compile-time value; a *runtime* value that merely uses effects (`catch`/`runStateToPair`, or any user `{Console}` body)
    * is runtime-concrete and reaches runtime-only leaves (`runThrow`), so eagerly reducing it would raise a spurious
    * native-leaf error. So the reduced path is taken only when the value is **runtime-abstract** (no runtime body) — the
    * compiler-only / redefined-in-compiler-layer case. Everything else keeps the ordinary raw-body
    * [[BindingContribution.Body]] path.
    *
    * On a missing reduction — the value did not produce a `CompilerMonomorphicValue` (an upstream compile error) — the
    * raw body path is kept as a fail-safe: it stays stuck on the abstract ability and surfaces a loud use-site mismatch,
    * never a silently wrong reduction.
