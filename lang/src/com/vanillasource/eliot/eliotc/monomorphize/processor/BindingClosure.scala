/** Turns a [[SaturatedValue]] into a binding (a `VTopDef` carrying a lazy body thunk) for the NbE evaluator, closing the
  * body over the [[NativeBinding]]s of its dependencies. The two callers differ in exactly one decision — which body the
  * value contributes — passed as `selfBody`:
  *   - the [[BindingMergerProcessor]], for a [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.fact.BindingContribution.Body]]
  *     contribution, uses [[OperatorResolvedValue.checkingRuntime]] (`opaque` bodies stay stuck);
  *   - the [[TransparentBindingProcessor]] uses [[OperatorResolvedValue.runtime]] (`opaque` bodies unfold for
  *     representation lowering).
  *
  * Reads the [[SaturatedValue]] (the same fact the monomorphize checker reads), not the raw [[OperatorResolvedValue]],
  * for two reasons: the saturated signature carries the binder roles ([[SaturatedValue.binderRoles]]) the wrap
  * consumes, and its leading binders line up with the type arguments the checker applies (saturation may prepend binders
  * for omittable `auto` parameters) — keeping the wrap's binder indices aligned (D6).
  *
  * The subtle, error-prone parts live here once: the mutual-recursion guard (via the runtime's active fact-request
  * chain, [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.processor.CompilerIO.activeFactKeys]] — never per-processor mutable state, so
  * it stays a pure function of the facts it reads), and the transitive dependency collection. Dependencies are always
  * resolved via [[NativeBinding]] (the checker's semantics, the bindings the bodies were type-checked against); only the
  * top-level value's own body selection differs between callers.

    * the ones it references in *value* position — so that applying the value's explicit type arguments substitutes
    * them.
    *
    * A type-stack parameter is a binder of the value's '''signature''' (a leading generic `[N]`), but it is '''not''' a
    * lambda of the '''runtime body''': `def bigOf[V] = V` has signature `(V: BigInteger) -> BigInteger` yet runtime
    * body just `V` (a bare reference, the reification of the erased `V`). Evaluated as-is under the empty env, that `V`
    * becomes a free [[SemValue.VNeutral]], so a later `bigOf[1]` only appends `1` to the neutral's spine instead of
    * reducing to `1` — and any computed type argument flowing through such a value (e.g. `h[subtract(N, bigOf[1])]`)
    * stays a stuck term that fails read-back ("Cannot resolve type."). Wrapping the reified binders as leading lambdas
    * makes the spine application substitute them, exactly as the checker does for the value's own monomorphization via
    * `bindTypeStackParam`.
    *
    * Which binders are reified — and the contiguous prefix to wrap (up to and including the last reified one, so
    * explicit-type-argument threading stays positionally aligned) — is the precomputed [[SaturatedValue.binderRoles]]
    * (D6). When nothing is reified the body is returned unchanged, so ordinary generics (e.g. `id[A](x: A) = x`, whose
    * `A` never appears in value position) keep their existing cached shape and implicit-type-argument application is
    * unaffected.
