/** The compiler platform's post-monomorphize **linker-executor** — the `used`-equivalent the runtime platform already has
  * (`docs/refinement-channel-follow-ups.md` §1). It evaluates a compiler-track value applied to concrete
  * argument metas and enforces the invariant that *post-monomorphize evaluation may only ever see monomorphized bodies*:
  * a raw (operator-resolved) callee body may appear only beneath a native leaf, never spliced into the reduction. The
  * cheap common case (a transfer bottoming at natives) pays nothing new; when the one-hop raw closure sticks on an
  * ability reference that a monomorphization would have exchanged for its exact impl, the loop *escalates* — it re-links
  * each stuck callee's own monomorphized (reduced-at-instantiation) form and re-evaluates.
  *
  * The stuck-driven loop skeleton ([[escalatingLoop]] + [[reducibleStuck]] + [[escalate]]) is the **one** mechanism the
  * in-checker read-back
  * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.PostDrainQuoter]]) and this channel-facing executor share: each
  * instantiates it with its own (eval function, escalation fetch), so they are one mechanism, not siblings. Each fetched
  * reduced form was itself produced by a read-back that ran this same loop, so the recursion lives in the cached,
  * `activeFactKeys`-guarded fact graph rather than in a closure-composition flag.
  *
  * '''Not the only seam for §1's invariant.''' [[CompilerNativesProcessor]] enforces the same "monomorphized bodies
  * only" invariant *eagerly*, at a different seam: it contributes a refinement artifact's reduced
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.fact.CompilerMonomorphicValue]] as a self-contained
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.fact.BindingContribution.Leaf]] (never the raw body) so a checking-time
  * evaluation — which is pure and cannot demand facts mid-eval — already closes over the monomorphized form. The two
  * cannot be merged (that purity boundary is exactly why one is eager and this one lazy); they are the eager and lazy
  * halves of the one invariant, not redundant.

    * (its ability-impl choices baked in) would silently stand in for the other. Such an FQN is therefore **declined**
    * (never escalated): the term stays stuck (a loud error on the checker read-back, a sound ⊤ on the channel path)
    * rather than splicing an arbitrary winner. An FQN referenced at a single instantiation (however many times) is
    * escalated as before.
