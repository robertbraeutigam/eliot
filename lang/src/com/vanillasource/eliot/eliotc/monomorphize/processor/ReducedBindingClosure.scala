/** Turns the compiler backend's *reduced* body (a [[MonomorphicExpression]] from
  * [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.fact.CompilerMonomorphicValue]]) into a self-contained [[NativeBinding]]
  * value (a `VTopDef` carrying a lazy thunk), closing the reduced body over its dependencies' [[NativeBinding]]s. The
  * [[MonomorphicExpression]] analogue of [[BindingClosure]] — same shape (a lazy self-contained thunk over one-hop
  * dependency bindings, mutual-recursion-guarded via the active fact-request chain), over the reduced compile-time tree
  * instead of the raw operator-resolved body.
  *
  * Used by [[CompilerNativesProcessor]] for a compiler-platform value whose body performs ability dispatch: its raw body
  * cannot reduce against the abstract ability method (`raise`/`pure` have no binding), so its `compiler`-label
  * contribution is this *reduced* form (the concrete `Either::raise`/`Either::pure`), which both the compiler track (when
  * it inlines the value into another compile-time reduction) and the runtime track (when it evaluates the value in a type
  * position) can then reduce.

  /** Reduce `vfqn` at concrete `typeArguments` on the **compiler track** and return its reduced body as a self-contained
    * NbE binding, or [[None]] if it produced no [[CompilerMonomorphicValue]] / has no reduced body.
    *
    * This is how a compile-time reduction reaches a callee's *reduced-at-its-instantiation* form: the stuck-driven
    * escalation shared by [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.PostDrainQuoter]] and
    * [[EscalatingReducer]] fetches this for each value reference that blocks a signature/body read-back.
    *
    * It always reduces **deep** ([[collectBindings]] with `deep = true`): each dependency is itself taken reduced at its
    * own instantiation, so a **stacked** carrier resolves through every layer — a reduced *function* body (`guardOr`,
    * `else`) keeps its impl-dispatch dependencies structural (they close over its runtime value parameters), and applying
    * it to concrete arguments must reach those dependencies already reduced (an `AbortCarrier` impl over the base
    * `Either` resolving through every layer) rather than a still-abstract raw binding. Deep is safe here because it is
    * only ever driven by [[EscalatingReducer.escalatingLoop]]'s laziness — a *stuck* term escalates, nothing else — so it
    * never eagerly monomorphizes a dependency evaluation does not demand. (The former one-hop `deep = false` mode existed
    * only to avoid that eager gotcha for the marker-guard reader, which now reads the marker's signature-twin mono
    * instead — no caller needs one-hop, so the flag is gone.) Always the compiler track: a compile-time reduction never
    * reaches a runtime target.
