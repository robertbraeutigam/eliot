    * lambdas are its *value* parameters, so an argument it cannot bind lands in the first value slot and shifts every
    * value argument one to the left, silently computing the wrong answer.
    *
    * **A native leaf.** A native's binding is the host-runnable function that remains once erased type arguments are
    * gone: `fold`'s takes its three value arguments and no type argument at all, and an implicit type argument was never
    * threaded into it. Since the row elaboration now *writes* a call's carrier (`fold[Id](..)`,
    * docs/effects-as-rows.md A.11.4), a native can meet a type argument it has no parameter for. A few natives do model
    * leading arguments — `Function[A, B]`'s two types, `integerLiteral[128]`'s `BigInteger` *value* (types are values,
    * so a literal is an ordinary type argument) — and those must still receive them. The native's own declared
    * `paramType` decides.
    *
    * The native's unsure direction is *not to apply*: dropping an argument a native did need leaves it an unapplied
    * native that fails loudly at read-back; applying one it did not would silently compute the wrong answer.
    *
    * **A binding that states its type-argument fit** keeps the argument in its spine — a bodied definition that does not
    * unfold is *identified* by that spine, which the unifier decomposes and the printer renders — and records that one
    * more leading entry is a type argument. Whether the body can actually bind it is settled later, where it matters, by
    * [[SemValue.VTopDef.TypeArgFit]] at unfold time. See there for the miscompile this separates out.
