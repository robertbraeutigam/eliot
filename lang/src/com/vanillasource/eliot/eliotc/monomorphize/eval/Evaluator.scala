    * A native (e.g. `add`/`min`/`lessThanOrEqual`) applied to an argument that was a still-unsolved metavariable at
    * evaluation time goes stuck as a [[VStuckNative]] (its `fire` returns this canonical stuck form) — and ordinary
    * [[force]] never re-fires it, because the stuck form has dropped the `VNative` reducer and `force` only unfolds
    * *cached* bodies. This bites dependent-bounds arithmetic: `Int[LMin,LMax] + Int[RMin,RMax]` has result type
    * `Int[add(LMin,RMin), add(LMax,RMax)]`, and when that codomain is computed during application inference the bound
    * metavariables are not yet solved, so each `add(?,?)` sticks. By the time the inferred type is compared against the
    * expected type the metavariables *are* solved, but the `add`s never reduced.
    *
    * `renormalize` walks the value, [[force]]ing through solved metas. For each [[VStuckNative]] it renormalises the
    * spine and, via `lookupNative`, re-applies the native [[VNative]] reducer to the renormalised arguments — so a
    * now-fully-concrete `add(3, 4)` reduces to `7`. If re-firing still produces the same stuck native (an argument is
    * genuinely still abstract), that stuck form (already carrying the renormalised arguments) is kept and no progress
    * loops. A body-less `VTopDef` (a type constructor like `Int`, or an abstract `def`) is rebuilt with renormalised
    * arguments so that stuck natives nested in its spine (the bounds of `Int[add(LMin,RMin), …]`) re-fire; everything
    * else is returned as forced.
    *
    * `deep` additionally descends under [[VPi]] binders. An *intermediate* function type — a partial application's
    * codomain or the type of a curried head reference (`(+) : Int[L] -> Int[R] -> Int[add(L,R), …]`) — carries the
    * not-yet-fully-applied bounds in its codomain, and is never the value handed to the result-renormalisation at the
    * application site, so its stuck natives are not re-fired there. They are harmless to compilation (the uncurry pass
    * discards intermediate types) but must still be re-fired before read-back so the strict quoter does not reject a
    * stuck native that would otherwise be dropped. `deep` is therefore used **only post-drain at quote time**
    * ([[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.monomorphize.check.PostDrainQuoter]]), where every metavariable is already
    * solved, so collapsing a binder's metas while descending is safe — unlike the shallow check-time use (e.g. the
    * application-result renormalisation), where metas under a binder may still be open mid-checking.
    *
    * `lookupNative` is the checker's binding cache (`vfqn => bindingCache.getOrElse(vfqn, None)`), which already holds
    * every native reachable from the term (prefetched before evaluation).
