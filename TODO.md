# TODO

Remaining work and open ideas. Completed or superseded items have been removed — for what is
already built, see the git history, the cornerstones in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and the memory
notes.

## Type system & language

- Add generics to function literals.
- Introduce arrays (records / multi-field `data` are already done).
- **Unify `Int` literal handling across the two tracks.** Managing the `BigInteger`/`Int` split
  between the compiler track and the runtime track is a constant source of friction. It cannot be
  solved by simply aliasing `type Int = BigInteger` on the compiler track, because `Int` carries
  meta-information that is itself expressed in terms of `BigInteger` (`type Int {range:
  Interval[BigInteger]}`). One unified handling of numeric literals for both tracks is wanted. The sharpest
  instance — a **transfer brace could not spell a number at all** — is fixed: a brace (and a `where`
  predicate) is compiler-track code, so its integer literals are bare `BigInteger`s, and an endpoint is
  written `Bounded(0)` / `Bounded(0 - 1)`. What remains is the general case: an *ordinary def body* is
  runtime-track, so a helper called from a brace still cannot name a `BigInteger` constant in value position —
  which is why `rangeWithin[Lo, Hi]` takes its bounds as type parameters.
- **Flow grades: quantitative computation tracking (cycles/WCET, stack, peak memory) on the
  effect row.** Design sketched 2026-07-10 in the bounds-as-refinements discussion. The dependency
  ladder is ranges → sizes → grades (fold cost needs sizes, frame sizes need ranges): the
  refinement channel's **ranges** domain has shipped, and so has a `String` `size` domain
  (`docs/string-length-meta.md`) — but a fold's cost is a function of a *collection's* size, so what
  this still waits on is **`List`/`Array` `size`**, the one that needs structural meta
  (`docs/total-meta-transfers.md` §2.3). Core idea: the effect row generalizes from "set of abilities" to
  "abilities + **named grades**" —
  `def onTick(s: State): {Timer, cycles: ≤800} Unit` — where a grade is *not* an ability
  (nothing is performed, nothing resolved or discharged) but a quantity with an algebra,
  registered per platform (`flow cycles {Interval[BigInteger]}` +
  `implement Grade[D] { seq (+), branch (interval hull → BCET..WCET), zero, within (≤) }`);
  the existing effect row is the powerset special case (seq = branch = union, within = ⊆).
  The §4.2 projection discipline transfers wholesale: a parameter's grade is referenced by slot
  projection (`step.cycles`), never bound; return-position entries are expressions (axiomatic on
  natives, checked contracts on bodied defs) — showcase, with cross-channel composition:
  `def fold[T, A](ls: List[T], init: A, step: F[A]): {cycles: ls.size.end * step.cycles + 7} F[A]`.
  Grade-only rows on pure functions do not force a carrier (precedent: negatives-only discharge
  rows are pure pass-throughs). Leaf grades are stated on native signatures by the platform
  layer (AVR datasheet cycle counts); width-dependent leaf costs are either expressions over the
  operands' value-metas or accounted post-lowering where `Represent`'s layout is known (same as
  stack frames). Accounting = generalize the effect walk (`EffectUsageCollector` + discharge-
  summary DAG) from the union lattice to arbitrary `Grade`s, run over the *residual* program
  (CTFE'd-away code costs zero). Covers: cycles (exact on cache-less simple cores — totality +
  monomorphization deleted the hard WCET subproblems: loop bounds come from sizes, no recursion,
  no indirect calls), max stack depth (sum frames / branch max over the whole-program DAG,
  post-lowering), and peak memory (composes as a monoid on `(net, peak)` pairs); an `Inf`
  super-loop's *step* carries the deadline budget — the real-time contract. Out of scope for the
  mechanism: in-place reuse (linearity is a type discipline, not meta-information) and hardware
  fidelity beyond simple cores. This supersedes the older idea of "WCET as type parameters /
  effects with type parameters" — quantities stay out of the type channel per the
  differentiation rule (doc §3).
- **Important:** after compilation the program should be guaranteed to fit all resources —
  memory, stack, etc. (Mechanism: the flow-grade system above, plus `Represent`-driven layout
  from the refinement channel.)

## Effects & I/O

- **A lambda body at a rowless arrow slot does not get its own pure region.** It is elaborated in
  the *enclosing* region, so a discharge written inline there lands on the caller's carrier
  instead of reaching the `Id` boundary:

  ```
  def call(f: Option[String] => String): {Console} Unit = printLine(readLine.f)
  def main: IO[Unit] = call(s -> s.orAbort else "")   // Expected: String, Actual: IO(String)
  ```

  `f`'s codomain is declared rowless, so by §1 rule 4 the lambda's body is a value position and
  its `else` should discharge to `Id` — which is exactly what happens when the same discharge sits
  in a named pure helper (`call(s -> orEmpty(s))` compiles and runs). This is the same principle as
  the block-tail fix in `a669f530` (a value position must reach the boundary), applied one level
  further in: `elaborateLambdaNatural` would take the slot's declared codomain rather than
  inheriting `region`. It is held back because it changes what "a lambda at a plain arrow slot"
  means for *every* call — the existing arm deliberately lets an effectful body become a bind chain
  on the enclosing carrier — so it is a rule decision, not a patch (doc standing rule 2). Pinned by
  `ExamplesIntegrationTest1`, "bind an effectful subject dotted into a function-typed parameter",
  whose handler is spelled around the gap.
- **Rule-4 violations are diagnosed twice, unequally.** A user pipe declaring no row
  (`|>[A, B](a: A, f: A => B): B`) given a computation gets the elaborator's own "This argument is
  a computation, but argument N of '|>' declares no effect row". The stdlib `.` — whose `f`
  declares `{Effect}` — instead hoists the subject and leaves the checker to report an
  unattributable `Type mismatch. Expected: IO(IO(Option(String)))` at the subject. Both are the
  same violation (`readLine.flatMap(f)`); only one names the slot.

## Syntax sugar & ergonomics

- String formatting as plain syntactic sugar for type-parameters:
  `s"Something $variable"` → `s["Something $variable"]`, where `s[STR: String]: String`.
  Because `STR` is a type-parameter, `s` is optimized away in favour of its result, so the
  parsing can be arbitrarily complex.
- Parse strings and numbers into custom types (string interpolation, regexp parsing, …);
  numeric literals are just a special case of this.
- Introduce a `UserShow[T]` — like `Show[T]`, but intended for end users.

## Optimization

- Lists consisting only of constants should not take runtime memory.
- **Sharpen the codegen phantom classification.** The `used` driver dedups its `MonomorphicValue`
  demand on a codegen-relevant projection of the type arguments (`saturate/fact/BinderRoles.scala`
  + `used/CodegenProjection.scala`), but a *true* phantom — a size index that never reaches
  representation — still classifies conservatively as representation, so identical code is not
  collapse-erased. Refining it is a code-size win, never correctness: the projection only ever
  folds code that is already identical.
- Can compile-time bounds be used to optimize the `Seq` implementation? (e.g. only `head` →
  linked list, only iteration → array.)
- Benchmark goal: complicated functions that generate an LED-light pattern should compile to a
  handful of instructions (uniting switching multiple LEDs into a single instruction), where a
  C compiler would compile everything.

## Compiler architecture & tooling

- **`getFact` still lives.** The processor-facing API is supposed to expose only `getFactOrAbort`
  / `getFactOrError` / `getFactIfProduced` (see `.claude/rules/eliot-design.md`), but a plain
  `getFact` is still there on `CompilationProcess` and its wrappers. Either rename it to
  `getFactIfProduced` or hide it entirely behind the three intent-carrying reads.
- `namedValues` can recurse — the reflection-driven enumeration is not protected against a value
  that reaches itself.
- **The warm build's dominant cost is JVM/library startup, and it is a packaging fix, not a
  compiler one.** Replacing Java serialization with explicit codecs over a content-addressed
  object store cut a warm build in half (load −79%, save −77%) and the cache is down to ~36% of
  it. §23 then measured what is left: **~41% of a warm build happens before `--statistics` starts
  counting** — JVM boot, log4j, cats-effect's `IORuntime.global` and Scala classloading. AppCDS
  would take a warm build from 1,331 ms to 908 ms (−32%, byte-identical jar, no compiler change)
  but is **declined**: it constrains ordinary JVM operation more than the time is worth. §24 then
  prices log4j — the biggest named piece — honestly: **~110 ms, ~8%, and there is no switch.** Not
  DNS (9 ms), not NIC enumeration (4 ms — LOG4J2-2717 is a Windows pathology), not the plugin scan
  (the `Log4j2Plugins.dat` cache works), not JMX (no measurable win in either spelling), not the
  version (2.25.4 is identical, if wanted as a currency upgrade). It is **603 classes** —
  log4j-core 502 + api 101, twice cats-effect's 292 — and the only way to get the 110 ms is to not
  load `log4j-core`. That is affordable: the whole compiler has **35 log call sites** (22 debug,
  7 error, 4 warn, 2 info) across 32 `Logging` types, so an internal logger replaces it. Fix the
  split output at the same time: errors go through `User`/`Console`, but the "Generated executable
  jar" success line is a log4j `info` — product output that any logging change can delete. After
  that, dispatch (105 ms, > all processors combined) is the only structured cost left inside the
  compile window. See `docs/incremental-compilation.md` §23–§24; §19 is the earlier profile.
  Left on the cache itself: caching *declines* (§6 step 3) and compaction (§13 step 5, no longer
  urgent since a warm build appends nothing).
- **Cache sharing across target directories.** One cache now accumulates across mains for the same
  roots and backend (§10), so the stdlib subgraph is built once per configuration rather than once
  per example. Two *different* compiler builds sharing a target directory still take turns
  replacing the region and both stay cold (§21) — correct, but never warm.
- Rename processors to generators?

## Microcontroller target

- You cannot set a pin `high` without first configuring it as an output — the type system
  should enforce this.
