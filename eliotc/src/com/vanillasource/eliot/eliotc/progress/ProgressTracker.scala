/** The mutable core of `--progress`: which phase the run is in, how many facts it has delivered out of how many it is
  * expected to, and what it is doing (`docs/progress-indication.md` §3.2, §3.5). Written by the session and the fact
  * engine, read by the [[ProgressLineWriter]]; created only when `--progress` is asked for.
  *
  * A fact counts **once**, at whichever comes first: a demand for it was answered, it was accepted from the cache, or it
  * was proven unchanged by the cache's validation drill. So a cold build and a warm one count towards the same figure,
  * and nothing about generation order matters — the set is concurrent, and each counter only ever grows.
  *
  * What the run is doing is kept as the set of **generations in flight**, each with its parent and whether it is
  * waiting for a fact. One that waits for nothing is doing the work; its time is charged to its **owner**, the nearest
  * described fact up its parents (itself, if it is described). The activity shown is the owner of the longest-running
  * such generation — a sample of where the time goes, which stays meaningful when several generations run at once.
  *
  * The same events time the run for its estimate (§3.4): a generation's own time — while it waits for nothing — is added
  * to its key type's cost when it ends, and an owner's time to its verb. The union of a generation's waits is what is
  * left out, never their sum, so facts asked for in parallel cannot drive a time negative.
  *
  * @param profile
  *   what the previous runs of this configuration learned: the total to measure against, absent on a first build, and
  *   the history the estimate of the time left comes from
