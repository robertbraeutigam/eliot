/** Wraps a processor to measure how often and for how long it runs. Intercepts the compilation process (see
  * [[TimedCompilationProcess]]) so the time the processor spends *waiting for facts* can be subtracted from its wall
  * time.
  *
  * The remainder is the processor's own time, and it is CPU time in practice: the compiler does no parallel work, and
  * although the engine generates each fact on its own fiber, the requesting fiber immediately blocks on it — so at most
  * one processor is running at any instant. There is also no double counting: a nested generation is measured by its
  * own wrapper, and its full duration is subtracted from the generation that asked for it. A wall clock is used rather
  * than a per-thread CPU clock because fibers migrate between pool threads, which would make the start and end reads of
  * a thread clock come from different threads.
  *
  * A generation that *aborts* — the sanctioned way for a processor to decline, and how an error propagates — would
  * short-circuit past the measurement, so the generation is run through `recoverWithAborted` and the abort re-raised
  * afterwards. That is exactly what the surrounding [[com.vanillasource.eliot.eliotc.processor.common.SequentialCompilerProcessors]]
  * already does with every processor it invokes, so the semantics are unchanged — and it keeps declines, which are
  * frequent and not free, from silently accumulating in the report's unaccounted remainder.
