/** The read half of the content-addressed store: decodes a value from the body region by following byte offsets
  * (`docs/incremental-compilation.md` §17).
  *
  * Reading is **demand-driven all the way down**. Nothing is decoded because it is present, only because something
  * asked for it: a value is read from its own offset, and each child is read only when its codec reaches the
  * reference. That is what makes the load side cheap on a warm build, where validation mostly compares ids and never
  * materialises the values behind them.
  *
  * A decoded object is memoized, so a subtree referred to from a thousand places is decoded once and shared in memory
  * as it was on disk. The memo is keyed by offset **and reader**, because an offset does not determine a type:
  * two types whose encodings coincide legitimately share one stored object, and `Sourced[String]` / `Sourced[Token]`
  * are enough to make that routine rather than exotic.
  *
  * @param bodies
  *   the whole body region; offsets index into it directly
