/** Computes a value's [[ObjectId]] without storing anything — what the equality cutoff asks
  * (`docs/incremental-compilation.md` §13 step 4).
  *
  * Deciding whether a recomputed fact is the one the cache holds used to mean materialising the stored side and
  * comparing field by field. Here only the *recomputed* side is touched: it is hashed exactly as
  * [[ContentAddressedOutput]] would have hashed it, and the answer is 16 bytes against 16 bytes.
  *
  * This is simpler than the storing writer for a reason worth stating: an id has no positions in it. The storing
  * writer keeps two buffers per object because a child contributes its *offset* to the stored body and its *id* to
  * the hash; with nothing stored there is one buffer, and a child contributes its id straight into its parent.
