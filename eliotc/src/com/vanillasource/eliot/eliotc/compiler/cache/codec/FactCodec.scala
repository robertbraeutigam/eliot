/** An explicit binary encoding for one type, written and read field by field.
  *
  * This is how the incremental cache persists facts (`docs/incremental-compilation.md` §13), in place of the Java
  * serialization it replaced. Two properties are the point, and both are lost the moment encoding is done reflectively
  * or by an `ObjectOutputStream`:
  *
  *   - **Nothing is written that the reader does not need.** A codec emits its own fields; the type is known from the
  *     position in the encoding, so no class descriptor — no class name, no `serialVersionUID`, no field names or
  *     types — appears in the data. Per-stream class descriptors are one of the two terms in the 7.5× / 17× per-entry
  *     blowups measured in §5 and §12.
  *   - **A type with no codec is a compile error, never a silent encoding.** There is no `FactCodec` for a function or
  *     an array, so a value that cannot satisfy the cache's equality-stability invariant (§2,
  *     `read(write(v)) == recompute(v)`) cannot be encoded by accident. That is exactly the defect class of §3.1
  *     (`SemValue.VNative`'s lambda serializes fine and never compares equal) and §4 (`ClassFile`'s array compares by
  *     reference): a reflective walker reproduces both silently, while a missing given cannot.
  *
  * Instances for product and sum types come from [[FactCodec.derived]] via the compiler's `Mirror`, so a case class
  * costs one line and states nothing about its own shape. Every instance is named rather than auto-derived: a type
  * that participates in a reference cycle (`Expression`, `SemValue`, `GroundValue` are all deeply recursive) would
  * otherwise expand its own derivation forever, and the named instance is also what makes coverage a list one can
  * read.
  *
  * Integers are varint-encoded, so the small values that dominate real data (collection sizes, sum-type tags, source
  * positions) cost one byte instead of four.
  *
  * **Structure sharing is a property of the [[Output]], not of the codecs.** A derived codec writes every product and
  * sum through [[Output.shared]]; what that does with a repeated value is the sink's decision. [[Output.Plain]] writes
  * every value out in full — independent frames, the §5 layout, which measured 4.89× the alternative.
  * [[ContentAddressedOutput]] makes each an object of its own and refers to it by offset; that is the one the cache
  * runs on, and it deduplicates across runs as well as within one while letting a reader chase only what it is asked
  * for.
