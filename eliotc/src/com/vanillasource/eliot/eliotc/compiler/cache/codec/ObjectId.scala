/** The identity of a stored object: a Merkle hash over what it encodes, with each child contributing its own id
  * (`docs/incremental-compilation.md` §13, §17).
  *
  * Nothing position-dependent enters it, which is what the store turns on:
  *
  *   - **equal ids mean equal values**, so an object is stored at most once — within a run and, because the id does not
  *     depend on anything run-specific, across runs too;
  *   - a recomputed value can be compared to a stored one by **16 bytes**, without reading the stored side at all — the
  *     equality cutoff that a warm build spends most of its validation in;
  *   - a **collision is a correctness fault**, not a slow path: two different values sharing an id would serve one in
  *     place of the other. That is why the digest is not truncated below 128 bits.
