/** The incremental cache over a content-addressed object store (`docs/incremental-compilation.md` §13, §17).
  *
  * Two files, with opposite lifecycles, which is why they are two:
  *
  *   - **the body region** (`.eliot-objects-<config>`) is **append-only**. Objects are referred to by byte offset, so
  *     an offset written last run still resolves this run precisely because nothing before it ever moves. A save
  *     appends what is new and rewrites nothing.
  *   - **the index** (`.eliot-index-<config>`) is rewritten every save. It is the only thing a load must read in full:
  *     per entry, where its key is, where its value is, and where each dependency's key is.
  *
  * **A value is never written twice.** This is not an optimisation but what makes the append model work at all: on a
  * warm build every entry survives, and re-encoding them would append the entire graph again on every run. A value
  * still in the store is placed from its [[ObjectId]] without being read, and one held in memory is *hashed before it
  * is encoded* — so a world leaf that recomputed to an equal-but-fresh object resolves to the bytes already on disk.
  * A warm build therefore appends nothing at all.
  *
  * Duplicate storage is still *possible* here, unlike in §13's original framing, because the ids carried between runs
  * are the entries' roots rather than every object: a genuinely new value re-appends any sub-object it shares with
  * something already stored. That is the deliberate trade for not persisting a whole `ObjectId → offset` index, which
  * measured *larger than the object bodies themselves*. Compaction reclaims it, and compaction is needed regardless —
  * the bodies are untyped bytes, so a mark-and-sweep cannot walk them and GC is necessarily a decode-and-re-encode of
  * the live entries.
  *
  * **Two compilers may share a target directory, and the cache is what is locked — never the build** (§21). A build
  * system blocks a second build because it owns the output; this owns only a cache, and a cache can always be thrown
  * away. So a third file, `.eliot-lock-<config>`, is held shared for a load and exclusively for a save, `tryLock`ed
  * for at most [[ContentAddressedCacheBackend.LOCK_TIMEOUT]] — and failing to get it is not an error: a load answers
  * `None`, a save does nothing, and the only cost either way is a full compilation. Three things make the locked
  * window sound rather than merely serialized:
  *
  *   - a save is based at the region's **actual** length, read under the lock, rather than the length its own load
  *     saw, so a compiler that appended in between is extended rather than overwritten;
  *   - the header carries a random **region id**, minted whenever the region is *replaced* and unchanged across every
  *     append, so offsets held in memory can be told to belong to a region that no longer exists;
  *   - the index is published by **atomic rename** after the bodies are appended, so a reader never sees half of one
  *     and an interrupted save leaves the previous cache intact.
  *
  * Both directions are fail-safe: `load` answers `None` on any problem (missing file, format or fingerprint mismatch,
  * a body region shorter than the index it was written with), and `save` warns rather than failing the build. The
  * worst either can do is cost a full compilation.
