/** Wraps a [[CompilationProcess]] so that every fact read via `getFact` while `key` is being generated is recorded into
  * `directDependencies` as one of `key`'s direct dependencies.
  *
  * Recording happens **eagerly, on each read** — before the generated fact's [[cats.effect.Deferred]] is completed (a
  * processor reads its inputs before registering its output). This matters for correctness: a fact's dependency set must
  * be fully recorded by the time the fact becomes observable, otherwise a concurrent consumer (or the end-of-run cache
  * build) could see an incomplete set. A fresh wrapper is used per generation, so recording is per-fiber.
  *
  * This wrapper is also the explicit home of the **active fact-request chain**: built once per generation with `key`
  * and the `ancestors` it was requested under, it precomputes `chain = key :: ancestors` (innermost first). It serves
  * that chain as [[activeFactKeys]] and threads it as the `ancestors` of every read it forwards, so the next generation
  * down sees `key` as its ancestor. The chain therefore flows explicitly through ordinary values — no ambient
  * fiber-local state.
  *
  * The chain is enforced here, not just published: a read of a key **already on the chain** would dead-lock the
  * [[cats.effect.Deferred]]-based fact cache (the in-progress computation would end up waiting on itself), so such a
  * read is refused — a "cyclic fact demand" error is recorded and `None` is returned, which the demanding processor's
  * `getFactOrAbort` turns into an abort. Processors that legitimately walk potentially-cyclic graphs still consult
  * [[activeFactKeys]] *before* demanding, so they can report a domain-specific error; this refusal is the engine-level
  * backstop for the unguarded case. The refused edge is deliberately **not** recorded as a dependency, so a cyclic edge
  * can never enter the persisted cache (where it would dead-lock validation).
  *
  * Facts a processor **pushes** — registered for keys other than the one being generated (e.g. one file-parse
  * registering every name's value) — are recorded in `producedDuring` as produced by this generation. The cache build
  * gives them this generation's dependency set: a pushed fact is a function of exactly what the generation that pushed
  * it read.
