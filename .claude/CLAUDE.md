# Claude Memory

## Project Overview

ELIOT is a functional, generic programming language for microcontrollers, implemented in Scala 3.

The project contains all parts of the compiler and the ELIOT standard library.

The compiler uses a plugin-based architecture with a fact-based compilation system and supports 
multiple backends (currently JVM).

## Build System

This project uses **Mill** (version 1.1.0+) as its build tool. Scala version: **3.7.4**.

Key dependencies: `cats-effect` (IO monad), `parsley-cats` (parser combinators), `ASM 9.9` (JVM bytecode in jvm module).

### Common Commands

```bash
# Compile all modules
./mill __.compile

# Run tests for all modules
./mill __.test

# Run tests for a specific module
./mill lang.test
./mill jvm.test
./mill eliotc.test

# Filter test output by class name (the -- flag is rejected by ScalaTest)
./mill lang.test 2>&1 | grep -v DEBUG | grep "ClassName"

# Clean build artifacts
./mill clean

# Run the compiler and generate and executable JAR file from the HelloWorld example
# The generate jar file will be under target/HelloWorld.jar
./mill examples.run jvm exe-jar examples/src/ -m HelloWorld

# To run the generated file, use java
java -jar target/HelloWorld.jar
```

### Module Structure

The project is organized into these compiler/runtime modules (defined in `build.mill`):

1. **eliotc** - Core compiler infrastructure (plugins, processors, feedback, utilities)
2. **lang** - Base compiler/language components (parsing, AST, type system, module system, resolution)
3. **stdlib** - The platform-independent base standard library (abstract `type`/`def` signatures only)
4. **jvm** - JVM backend (bytecode generation using ASM, JAR generation)
5. **examples** - Example ELIOT programs

### IDE Tooling (`ide/`)

Everything editor/IDE-related lives under the top-level **`ide/`** directory:

- **`ide/lsp/`** - The LSP language server. This is a Mill module nested under `ide`, so its build
  target is **`ide.lsp`** (e.g. `./mill ide.lsp.compile`, `./mill ide.lsp.test`, `./mill ide.lsp.jar`);
  its build output lands under `out/ide/lsp/`. Depends on `lang` + `stdlib`; main class is `LspMain`.
  - `ide/lsp/package.sh` builds a runnable distribution under `ide/lsp/dist/` (git-ignored). It
    deliberately produces a `lib/` of **separate per-module jars**, never a fat assembly jar — a fat jar
    collapses same-path layer resources (e.g. `String.els` in both `lang` and `stdlib`) and silently
    drops a layer. See the script header and [[gotcha_assembly_jar_breaks_layers]]. It also stages a
    second classpath dir `compiler-lib/` (the `jvm` backend jar + ASM) — the extra jars the "Run main"
    feature needs to *build* an executable jar; kept out of `lib/` so the resident server still type-checks
    the abstract (platform-independent) workspace.
  - `ide/lsp/intellij/` - manual *user-defined server* setup for LSP4IJ (zero-build fallback): setup
    guide + importable template. Superseded for normal use by the shipped plugin in `ide/intellij/`.
  - Status: the spine is built & verified — whole-workspace diagnostics, hover/go-to-def (reverse
    `PositionIndex`), live-edit VFS overlay, in-scope-name completion, **concrete-type hover hints**
    (`TypeHintIndex` built from `MonomorphicValue` facts; `LspPlugin` monomorphizes each file's own `main`
    via `UsedNames`, so hover shows `Int[0,255]`/`A -> B` — first step only, no error recovery yet so it is
    empty on a broken buffer, never wrong), **"Run main" code lens** (server advertises `codeLensProvider`;
    `MainIndex` — built per compile from `ResolvedValue`s named `main` — yields a `▶ Run main` lens carrying
    the `eliot.runMain` command with `[sourceRoot, moduleName]`; handled client-side, see `ide/intellij`),
    **apidoc doc hover** (hover renders Markdown = an `eliot`-fenced type/signature header + the identifier's
    documentation; `DocIndex` built from `ValueDoc` facts. The `apidoc` module now participates in the pipeline: its
    `ValueDocProcessor` turns the parser's `/** */` doc comments into per-`ValueFQN` `ValueDoc` facts, `ApiDocPlugin`
    registers that processor and its HTML `run` consumes those same facts — so the site and hover share one source of
    truth. The LSP depends on `apidoc` and activates `ApiDocPlugin` as a *non-target* plugin, so only the processor runs,
    never HTML generation; `LspPlugin` demands a `ValueDoc` per name across every layer so stdlib docs hover too),
    IntelliJ via LSP4IJ. The one remaining design item,
    parser/checker **error recovery** (compiler tolerance for broken code), is tracked in
    `docs/ide-type-hints.md` (Layers A/B) and is what makes type hints work on in-progress code; the rest
    (find-refs, rename, semantic tokens, signature help) are routine additive features on the existing index.
- **`ide/textmate/`** - TextMate grammar for `.els` syntax highlighting (VS Code extension layout;
  consumable by IntelliJ TextMate Bundles and VS Code). Static editor files, *not* a build module.
- **`ide/intellij/`** - the shipped IntelliJ plugin: one install gives `.els` highlighting (bundles
  `ide/textmate`) + diagnostics (launches the `ide/lsp` server via LSP4IJ) + a **native "Eliot Application"
  run configuration**. It is a **self-contained Gradle build** (the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin has no
  Mill equivalent), *not* part of the Mill build; its `prepareSandbox` shells out to `ide/lsp/package.sh`
  for the per-module server jars (never a fat jar — [[gotcha_assembly_jar_breaks_layers]]) and the
  `compiler-lib/` jars, and runs the server out-of-process via the IDE's JBR. Build with
  `cd ide/intellij && ./gradlew runIde|buildPlugin`. See `ide/intellij/README.md`.
  - **Run main** (`src/main/kotlin/.../run/`): the server's `▶ Run main` code lens fires the `eliot.runMain`
    command, which LSP4IJ dispatches client-side to `EliotRunMainCommandAction` (an `LSPCommandAction`
    registered as the IntelliJ action id `eliot.runMain` — the id MUST equal the command). It creates/reuses
    an `EliotRunConfiguration` (`ConfigurationType`/`Factory`/`Options`/`SettingsEditor`) with a before-run
    `EliotBuildBeforeRunTaskProvider` that runs the compiler CLI (`java -cp server/lib+compiler/lib …Main jvm
    exe-jar <root> -m <module> -o <out>`) to build `<out>/<module>.jar`, then the run config does
    `java -jar`. The build step gates on the compiler's exit code — `Main` now returns `ExitCode.Error` when
    `CompilationResult` has errors (`Compiler.runCompiler: IO[Boolean]`), so a stale jar is never run.

When adding new editor integrations, place them under `ide/`.

## Architecture

### Plugin System

The compiler uses a **ServiceLoader-based plugin architecture**:

- Plugins are discovered via Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism
- Each plugin implements `CompilerPlugin` (in eliotc module)
- Plugins can depend on other plugins and configure the compilation pipeline
- Two main plugins:
  - `LangPlugin` - Provides core language compilation (tokenization → AST → type checking)
  - `JvmPlugin` - Provides JVM bytecode generation and executable JAR output

### Compilation Pipeline

The compiler follows a **fact-based compilation model**:

1. **Facts** are pieces of immutable compilation data (tokens, AST, resolved types, etc.)
2. **Processors** (sometimes referred to as "Generators") compute facts from other facts on demand
3. **FactGenerator** orchestrates lazy fact computation with caching
4. Facts are identified by their keys, which are usually a subset of the fact's data

### Main components of processing pipeline

Each of these is a package in the "lang" module, roughly in order of processing:

1. source: Reading source files from the filesystem
2. token: Tokenizer
3. ast: Building the AST
4. core: Building the core language AST
5. module: Splitting working with modules into working with individual values. It also unifies similarly named modules from different paths.
6. resolve: Resolve all identifiers to fully qualified names or parameters.
7. matchdesugar: Desugar pattern-match expressions into function applications. Checks exhaustiveness and handles nested patterns, multiple cases, constructor patterns, and wildcards.
8. operator: Resolve infix operators with proper precedence and associativity. Transforms flat expressions into correctly structured function applications.
9. effect: Definition-local effect *verification* only (`EffectCheckProcessor`, fed by the `EffectUsageCollector`
   accounting walk): the declared-effects subset check (which is also what propagates `Inf`) and the "declared pure but
   performs effects" fail-safe. The body auto-lift itself is NOT here — it is type-directed elaboration in the
   monomorphize checker (see below and `docs/effect-lift-in-checker.md`).
10. ability: Checks and returns a type-specific ability implementation.
11. monomorphize: Monomorphic type checker. Evaluates data type and value definitions into typed structures and checks all types at their usage with all instantiated values, using the single NbE evaluator. (This phase absorbed the former standalone `eval` phase, which was removed.) Also hosts the **effect auto-lift** (`check/EffectLifter`): the bind/`pure` decision for an effectful term in a pure position is check-mode elaboration per concrete instantiation — undecidable from declared signatures alone — with flex argument slots deferred until later arguments rigidify them (Phase A/B in `Checker.inferSpine`).
12. used: Collects all the used value names starting at a given "main".
13. uncurry: Uncurries function calls, so its easier to generate on the backend.

### Error Handling

- Errors are reported through `CompilationIO` monad (in lang module)
- `SourcedError` tracks errors with source position information
- `User` and `Logging` traits provide user-facing messages and debug logging

## Testing

- Tests extend `AsyncFlatSpec` with `AsyncIOSpec` with `Matchers`
- Test files are in `<module>/test/src/` directories
- A processor test that needs more than a couple of leaf phases runs the **whole** pipeline via the shared
  `plugin.LangProcessors` builder — `extends ProcessorTest(LangProcessors()*)` (or with `systemModules = …` /
  `maxNestedRepeats = …` when those differ) — never a hand-listed prefix of processors. Computation is demand-driven and
  `SequentialCompilerProcessors` dispatches each key to its one handling processor, so a harness triggering only an early
  fact simply never runs the later phases; carrying the full pipeline is free and a new phase is then added in exactly
  one place. Only true leaf tests (tokenizer/AST/core, or a manual-fact-injection harness) list processors explicitly.
  The jvm backend test reuses the same list and appends its backend processor: `LangProcessors(…) :+ JvmClassGenerator()`.

## Language Cornerstone: Types Are Values (λ\*)

Eliot has **no internal distinction between the type level and the value level**. Type
constructors (`Int[..]`) and value constructors (`Int(..)`) are both ordinary named values
("functions"), and the type *of* a value is itself just another value. The only thing that makes
a computation "type-level" is *when* it is forced: type-level code happens to be evaluated by the
compiler before code generation, but that staging is incidental, not a difference in kind.
Formally this is a **non-stratified Pure Type System** — λ\* / "type-in-type" (`Type : Type`) —
where the compile-time/runtime split is a pure **phase / erasure** distinction and type checking is
implemented as **Normalisation by Evaluation** (the `monomorphize` package: one `Evaluator`, one
`SemValue` domain shared by types and values, `VType` as an ordinary value). This is deliberately
*not* "dependent types" as a bolted-on feature; dependency is merely a consequence of types being
values. Accepted trade-off: `Type : Type` is logically inconsistent (Girard's paradox) — fine for a
general-purpose language, with termination/totality handled separately rather than by a universe
hierarchy.

**Sanctioned sugar vs. required discipline.** Familiar surface distinctions are *intentional sugar*,
not violations: the `Qualifier.Type`/`Qualifier.Default` namespaces, the `[]` vs `()` call/pattern
syntax, and the restricted `Expression.typeParser` all collapse to "the same `FunctionDefinition`
with a different qualifier tag." What the cornerstone *requires* of every task: there is exactly one
evaluator and one value domain (never a second, weaker "compile-time" interpreter); type equality is
definitional (force/normalise via that evaluator, then compare) rather than a parallel bespoke
mechanism; and kind/arity metadata (e.g. `RoleHint.TypeConstructor`) stays out of semantic phases.

The cornerstone-fidelity clean-ups are **complete** (the tracking plan has been retired). Durable
guardrails it leaves behind: (1) `unify` is *pure definitional equality* — directional `Int` widening
is a user-defined `Coerce` ability inserted in the checker's check mode (now *implemented*, and as of D4
factored into its own refinement-lattice module:
`monomorphize.refine.RefinementSolver.unifyOrCoerce`/`tryCoerce`/`buildCoercedExpr`), never a `refinements` map / assignability arm in the unifier; (2) `VPi` is the one primitive Π-former
*on principle* — do not fold `Function` into an ordinary `data` declaration; (3) kind/arity metadata
(`RoleHint`, esp. `typeParamCount`) must not drive any typing decision — its only sanctioned reads are
constructor-shape reconstruction for `match`.

## Language Cornerstone: Platform-Independence via Layers

Eliot targets everything from an ATtiny to the JVM, so the language and its base stdlib commit to **no
platform assumptions** — not even the size of an `Int`. The rule is **no platform *representation***: the base
layer never says how a type is laid out or how a primitive is computed. So everything representation- or
platform-dependent is declared **abstractly** — `type`s without a value constructor, body-less `def`
signatures (`Int`, `printLine`, the `+`/`-`/`*` operators whose bodies do width dispatch). It *may*, however,
carry `def` bodies and ability instances when the computation is **genuinely platform-independent** — byte-for-byte
the same on every target (e.g. `fitsIn`, the effect discharge helpers `catch`/`orElse`/`runState`, the pure
type-level `Combine[Int,Int]` join). What it must never contain is `data` (a chosen representation), a native
leaf, or any representation-dependent body.

- `type Int[MIN: BigInteger, MAX: BigInteger]` — an abstract type; no value constructor, no chosen width.
- `def printLine(s: String): IO[Unit]` — an abstract function; signature only, no implementation.
- `type Byte = Int[-128, 127]` — a `type` *with* a body is just an alias; still platform-neutral.

A `type X = ...` (alias) and a body-less `type X` differ only by the presence of a body; a `data X(...)`
declaration is the *concrete* form that additionally introduces a value constructor. **The base stdlib
must avoid `data` and any native or representation-dependent body** — those belong to platform layers;
platform-independent bodies (identical on every target) are allowed. For the operational mechanics of
placing/moving `.els` files across layers — the two-pool (compiler vs runtime) resolution, the
abstract↔concrete merge, and its signature-match gotchas — use the **`eliot-layers`** skill.

**Layers = redefinition, not inheritance.** A platform "implements" an abstract definition by simply
*defining the same name again*, in its own root path, with a body. There is no `extends`, `override`
keyword, or instance mechanism — co-located definitions of the same qualified name across root paths are
**merged**, preferring the concrete one. Example: base declares `type IO[A]` and `def printLine(...): IO[Unit]`
(abstract); the `jvm` layer redefines `data IO[A](block: Function[Unit, A])` and
`def printLine(s) = IO(_ -> printLineInternal(s))` (concrete). The compiler unifies them into a single value.

**Layers *mix*, they do not *stack*; every file must stand on its own.** Name resolution is per-file (a file's
dictionary is its own declarations + imports, never names declared in a *sibling* file of the same module). So when one
file needs a name another file of the same module declares — e.g. a carrier-generic ability instance
`implement[F[_] ~ Sync] Console[F]`, which must be colocated with its ability and therefore lives in the ability's
module — that file must **re-declare (copy) what it needs** (here, `ability Console[F[_]]` itself); the merge then
**verifies the copies agree** (`signatureEquality`) rather than letting them drift. Duplication is the sanctioned
mechanism here — do *not* "fix" a cross-file reference by widening the resolver to span sibling files.

**How it works mechanically** (the `source` + `module` packages):
- The compiler is given multiple **root paths** (CLI roots + classpath resources). `PathScanner`
  (`source/scan/PathScanner.scala`) resolves a module path against *all* roots and returns *every*
  matching file as one `PathScan`.
- `ModuleNamesProcessor` extracts names per file; `UnifiedModuleNamesProcessor` flattens the name sets of
  all files for a module into one.
- For each name, `UnifiedModuleValueProcessor.scala` collects the `ModuleValue` from every file that
  defines it and calls `unifyValues`. The abstract/concrete distinction is carried by
  `core/fact/NamedValue.scala`'s `runtime: Option[Sourced[Expression]]` — `None` = abstract (no body),
  `Some` = concrete. Unification rules:
  - **Prefer the implementation**: pick the value whose `runtime.isDefined`; if none, keep the abstract one.
  - **Reject conflicts**: more than one implementation → "Has multiple implementations."; differing
    signatures → "Has multiple different definitions." (`signatureEquality` must hold across all layers, so
    a layer may add a body but must not change the signature).

So "implementing the abstract stdlib for a platform" = adding a layer (a root path) that re-declares the
same names with bodies / as `data`. The base stays universal; each platform fills in representation and
behaviour. (`data` desugars to an abstract type-constructor `FunctionDefinition` plus value-constructor
functions via `DataDefinitionDesugarer`, so even concrete types reduce to the same `NamedValue` model.)

### The compiler is itself a platform (where compile-time code lives)

The **compiler is its own platform**, peer to runtime platforms like jvm. Source resolution is **platform-scoped**
(the `platform` marker — `compiler` / `runtime` — is a key dimension threaded through the front-end): the NbE checker
resolves names in the `compiler` platform; codegen (`used → uncurry → backend`) resolves in the `runtime` platform.
So one abstract base name can have a **distinct concrete implementation per platform** — exactly as `add`/`fold`/`Bool`
already do via the native-binding routing (`ContributedBinding` + `BindingMergerProcessor`: the compile-time reduction
wins for checking, the runtime body is used for codegen). There is no "shared" platform: each unifies the base + the
user program + its own layer independently. This is built and in place — the
`compiler` source pool, the always-linked `compiler` Mill module, the native label that reads it
(`CompilerNativesProcessor`, contributing the `compiler` `ContributedBinding` from the compiler-marker `SaturatedValue`),
and the module's **first content** all exist. CP4 is the compile-time `Either` carrier
(`compiler/eliot/eliot/lang/Either.els`: concrete `data Either` + `foldEither` + `implement
Effect[Either[String]]`/`Throw[String, Either[String]]`), with abstract `type Either[E, A]` promoted to the `stdlib` base
and the runtime `jvm` `Either` unchanged — structurally identical, so the compiler overlay is transparent for runtime
uses (the `add` pattern). The remaining compile-time intrinsics (`add`, `Bool` `fold`, `true`/`false`) are still Scala
native **leaves** in `SystemNativesProcessor` / `StdlibNativesProcessor` — the compiler platform's leaf bottom, mirroring
jvm's bytecode leaves. The `Effect`/`Throw` instances are compiler-pool-only; the effectful-signatures discharge (W2b,
landed — `monomorphize/check/CalculatedReturnResolver.scala`: a `{Throw[String]}` return on the `Either[String, _]`
carrier reads back as `Right(t)` ⤳ the type `t` / `Left(msg)` ⤳ a diagnostic) recognises the carrier's `Left`/`Right` by
FQN and reduces `fold`/`foldEither` via the merged `NativeBinding`, so those instances are reached only once the W5
combinators are written monadically.

**Where to put new compiler code.** When a task needs something the compiler must *evaluate at compile time* — a
carrier (e.g. the effectful-signatures `Either`), a compile-time intrinsic, or an ability instance used only during
checking — and it is expressible in ordinary Eliot, write it as **Eliot in the compiler-platform module** (a Mill
module depending on `stdlib`, shipping resources under the compiler prefix), keeping the abstract signature in
`lang`/`stdlib` and the *runtime* concrete impl in `jvm`. Do **not** put `data`/bodies in the abstract base (it stays
representation-free, per the cornerstone above), and do **not** reimplement `data`/`match`/instances as Scala
`SemValue`s — the one NbE evaluator already runs them, so a Scala reimplementation is the single-evaluator
anti-pattern. Reserve Scala natives (`SystemNativesProcessor`/`StdlibNativesProcessor`) for genuinely primitive
**leaves** no Eliot body can express (arbitrary-precision arithmetic, `Bool` branching) — these are the compiler
platform's leaf bottom, mirroring jvm's bytecode leaves.

## Language Cornerstone: Use-Site Verification (Sound, Not Modular)

Eliot does not prove a definition correct for every instantiation it *could* receive (modular completeness); it
guarantees every instantiation that *actually manifests* — the whole program is monomorphized from `main` — is
fully type-checked. Soundness is total (**no incorrect program compiles**); only the modular per-definition
certificate is given up.

**Mechanism.** An obligation that can't be discharged abstractly (binders left neutral) — a bound-dependent
`Coerce`/operation, an ability impl, a calculated bound — is **deferred to the concrete use site**, where the one
NbE checker decides it exactly. A modular checker would instead reject the definition or demand a constraint; Eliot
accepts it and verifies each use — the same monomorphize-from-`main` stance already used for codegen and ability
resolution, extended from compilation to correctness. Applies to the *implicit/calculated layer* (`infer` params,
calculated returns — the `auto`/implicit-generics feature, shipped — and abilities); explicit parametric defs still
get the ordinary abstract check.

**Trade-off** (intentional): more burden on library authors (totality comes from *tests* — generators + probing,
see `docs/ide-type-hints.md` — not a proof); users may meet a type error "not of their making" (a library's latent partiality surfacing
at the use site, which the IDE should surface at the definition first); completely **safe** (every manifest use is
checked); far more **powerful** (full dependent/computed types — bounds, costs, resources — at near-zero
annotation, zero type-level proof obligations, no inversion, accepting functions a modular system would reject).
This is **not a silent gap**: it is complete verification of the actual program, hard-erroring at the use site,
never silent acceptance of wrong typing (cf. [[feedback_gaps_must_be_failsafe]]).

Principle: *we prove a definition correct for every input it does take, not every input it could take — and reject
any program in which some input it does take is wrong.*

## Language Cornerstone: Total by Default (No Recursion; `Inf` is the Opt-Out)

**Eliot user code cannot express recursion or loops — full stop.** There is no `fix`/`letrec`, lambda parameters
are non-recursive, and every cycle is therefore a self/mutual reference among top-level named values, visible in the
resolved value-reference graph. The `termination` package gates this: `RecursionCheckProcessor` (running
`RecursionChecker`), placed after operator resolution and before the effect checks, rejects any cycle in a value's
**runtime-body** reference graph (`"Value 'X' is defined recursively."`) — body only, never the signature, so a
covariant `data Tree(left: Tree, right: Tree)` and the monad-transformer lift are not flagged. A rejected value never
produces its `RecursionCheckedValue` fact, so it never reaches saturation or monomorphization (fail-safe by
construction). Every actual loop instead lives inside a **platform-provided native** (a `fold`, `forever`, the event
loop); the language mandates no recursion primitive of its own. Three preconditions make "no recursion" mean what it
says: an **occurs-check** in `Unifier` (no inferred infinite type / Y-combinator), a **strict-positivity check**
(`core.processor.StrictPositivityChecker`, no negative-recursive `data`), and **purity** (no mutable cells — Landin's
knot; guarded by `termination/PurityGuardTest`). With a recursion-free typed core, **every program terminates by
default** (System T, not PCF) — modulo the already-accepted `Type:Type`/Girard residual the Cornerstone does not close.

The one opt-out is **`Inf`**, modelled as an ordinary effect *ability* (`stdlib/.../Inf.els`:
`ability Inf[F[_]] { def forever(step: F[Unit]): F[Unit] }`, import-required) rather than a bespoke termination
lattice — there is **no `Terminating` token**; termination is simply `Inf`'s *absence* from the effect row. Because a
recursion-free core cannot itself diverge, `Inf` can **only originate on a native** (`forever`), and it propagates to
callers for free through the *existing* `used ⊆ declared` effect subset check — a `{Console}`-only function calling
`forever` is rejected ("performs the effect 'Inf' but does not declare it"). `Inf` is **run, not discharged**: it is
the one effect that may legitimately reach `main` undischarged (the jvm layer's `implement Inf[IO]` realizes `forever`
as a `while(true)` loop), where it denotes a deliberate non-terminating program — a server / firmware super-loop.
Higher-order propagation is automatic: `Inf` rides the shared carrier like any effect (the function-coloring win — one
effect-transparent combinator is `Inf`-iff-its-step-is), with no per-arrow bit. Deferred (needs foundations that do not
yet exist): WCET/resource bounds and optional size-indexing, a *timeout*-based bound on `{Inf}` (needs a time type),
and linearity for in-place mutation. See [[project_recursion_as_effect]].

## Language Overview

Eliot is a functional, strongly-typed language, with whole-application compilation
with monomorphization.

The main building blocks of the language are:
- Named values: These are a generalization of "functions", because functions are represented in their fully 
                curried form as "a -> b -> c", so it's a lambda value. They are "named" because they are not
                anonymous and can be referenced ("called") from elsewhere.
- Data: Data is completely represented as values in the core model and has no own unique representation. 
        Data defines a value constructor "function" (if not abstract), and a type constructor function. Both are
        "normal" values / "functions".
- Abilities and ability implementations: These are typeclasses and typeclass instances, with multi-parameter capability. Ability implementations
        must be defined either in the module where the ability is defined or with the type they are defined for.
        Ability implementations must be unique for a given type combination in the whole search space, with no overlap.
        References to ability values are fully resolved during monomorphization, they are not passed around in
        structures as in some other languages.

## Compiler Change Patterns

- When making a field optional in `resolve.fact.Expression` case classes, update ALL pattern matches across
  the codebase (eval, monomorphize phases) **and** test files that directly construct those cases.
- There is a **single** evaluator (`monomorphize/eval/Evaluator.scala`, NbE over `SemValue`); the
  old separate `eval`/`interpret` compile-time evaluator was removed. Unresolved/stuck terms surface
  as explicit errors at quote time (`PostDrainQuoter`, "Cannot resolve type."), never via a silent
  `Type` fallback. Do not reintroduce a second compile-time evaluator (see the Language Cornerstone).

## Development Notes

- The language is still in active development (see TODO file for planned features)
- Current focus is on microcontroller targets, though JVM is the implemented backend
- The type system aims to support dependent types and compile-time guarantees about resource usage
- The standard library (`stdlib/`) is currently minimal
